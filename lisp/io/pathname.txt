A pathname is a portable way of specifying a file. A pathname has
six components: host, device, directory, name, type, and version.
You can make one by calling make-pathname with one or more of the
corresponding keyword arguments. In the simplest case, you could
just specify the name and let the rest of the pathname default:

    (setf path (make-pathname :name "myfile"))
    (setf str (open path :direction :output
                         :if-exists :supersede))
    (format str "Something~%")
    (close str)
