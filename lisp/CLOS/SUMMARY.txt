Summary
=======

1. In object-oriented programming, the function f is defined implicitly via
   the f methods of the objects that have them. Objects inherit methods from
   their parents.

2. Defining a class is like defining a structure, but more verbose. A shared
   slot belongs to a whole class.

3. A class inherits the slots of its superclasses.

4. The ancestors of a class are ordered into a precedence list. The preced-
   ence algorithm is best understood visually.

5. A generic function consists of all the methods with a give name. A method
   is identified by its name and the specializations of its parameters.
   Argument precedence determines the method used when a generic function is
   called.

6. Methods can be augmented by auxiliary methods. Standard method combination
   means calling the around-method, if there is one; otherwise the before-,
   most specific primary, and after-methods.

7. In operator method combination, all the primary methods are treated as
   arguments to some operator.

8. Encapsulation can be done via packages.

9. There are two methods of object-oriented programming. The generic function
   model is a generalization of the message-passing model.
