# Container Benefits

## Agile application creation and deployment

Increased ease and efficiency of container image creation compared to VM image
use.

## Continuous development, integration, and deployment

Provides for reliable and frequent container image build and deployment with
quick and easy rollbacks (due to image immutability).

## Dev and Ops separation of concerns

Create application container images at build/release time rather than deployment
time, thereby decoupling applications from infrastructure.

## Observability

Not only surfaces OS-level information and metrics, but also application health
and other signals.

## Environmental consistency across development, testing, and production

Runs the same on a laptop as it does in the cloud.

## Cloud and OS distribution portability

Runs on Ubuntu, RHEL, CoreOS, on-prem, Goole Kubernetes Engine, and anywhere
else.

## Application-centric management

Raises the level of abstraction from running an OS on virtual hardware to run an
application on an OS using logical resources.

## Lossely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated micro-services

Applications are broken into smaller, independent pieces and can be deployed and
managed dynamically - not a fat monolithic stack running on big single-purpose
machine.

## Resource isolation

Predictable application performance.

## Resource utilization

High efficiency and density.
