#1#
    8 nesting levels of comditional inclusion.

#2#
    8 nesting levels for #included files.

#3#
    32 nesting levels of parenthesized expressions within
    a full expression. This will probably occur when using
    macros.

#4#
    1024 macro identifiers simultaneously. Can happen if one
    includes too many header files.

#5#
    509 characters in a logical source line. This is a serious
    restriction if it applies after preprocessing. Since a macro
    expansion always results in one line, this affects the
    maximum size of a macro. It is unclear what the Standard
    means by a logical source line in this context and in most
    implementations

#6#
    6 significant initial characters in an external identifier.
    Usually this constraint is imposed by the environment, e.g.,
    the linker, and not by the compiler.

#7#
    127 members in a single structure or union.

#8#
    31 parameters in one function call. This may cause trouble
    with functions that accept a variable number of arguments.
    Therefore, it is advisable that when designing such functions
    that either the number of parameters be kept within reasonable
    bounds or that alternative interfaces be supplied, e.g.,
    using arrays.
