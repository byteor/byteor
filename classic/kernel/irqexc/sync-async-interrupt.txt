Synchronous
===========

interrupts are produced by the CPU control unit while executing
instructions and are called synchronous because the control
unit issues them only after terminating the execution of an
instruction.


Asynchronous
============

interrupts are generated by other hardware devices at arbitrary
times with respect to the CPU clock signals.
