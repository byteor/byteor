suid
====

A process executing a file normally keeps the User ID (UID) of the process
owner. However, if the executable file has the suid flag set, the process
gets the UID of the file owner.

sgid
====

A process executing a file  keeps the user group ID of the process group.
However, if the executable file has the sgid set, the process gets the user
group ID of the file.

sticky
======

An executable file with the sticky flag set corresponds to a request to the
kernel to keep the program in memory after its execution terminates.


When a file is created by a process, its owner ID is the UID of the process.
Its owner user group ID can be the process group ID of the creator process
or the user group ID of the parent directory, depending on the value of the
sgid flag of the parent directory.
