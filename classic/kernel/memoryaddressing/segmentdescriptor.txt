segment descriptor fields
=========================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Field name     Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Base           Contains the linear address of the first byte of the
                segment

 G              Granularity flag: if it is cleared (equal to 0), the
                segment size is expressed in bytes; otherwise, it is
                expressed in multiples of 4096 bytes.

 Limit          Holds the offset of the last memory cell in the segment,
                thus binding the segment length. When G is set to 0, the
                size of a segment may vary between 1 byte and 1 MB;
                otherwise, it may vary between 4KB and 4GB.

 S              System flag: if it is cleared, the segment is a system
                segment that stores critical data structures such as the
                Local Descriptor Table; otherwise, it is a normal code
                or data segment.

 Type           Characterizes the segment type and its access rights

 DPL            Descriptor Privilege Level: used to restrict accesses
                to the segment. It represents the minimal CPU privilege
                level requested for accessing the segment. Therefore,
                a segment with its DPL set to 0 is accessible only when
                the CPL is 0 -- that is, in Kernel Mode -- while a
                segment with its DPL set to 3 is accessible with every
                CPL value.

 P              Segment-Present flag: is equal to 0 if the segment is
                not stored currently in main memory. Linux always sets
                this flag (bit 47) to 1, because it never swaps out
                whole segments to disk.

 D or B         Called D or B depending on whether the segment contains
                code or data. Its meaning is slightly different in the
                two cases, but it is basically set (equal to 1) if the
                addresses used as segment offsets are 32 bits long, and
                is cleared if they are 16 bits long.

 AVL            May be used by the operating system, but it is ignored
                by Linux.
