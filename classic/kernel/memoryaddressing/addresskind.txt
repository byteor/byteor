logical address
===============

Included in the machine language instructions to specify the address of an
operand or of an instruction. This type of address embodies the well-known
80x86 segmented architecture that forces MS-DOS and Windows programmers to
divide their programs into segments. Each logical address consisits of a
segment and an offset (or displacement) that denotes the distance from the
start of the segment to the actual address.

linear address (also known as virtual address)
==============================================

A signle 32-bit unsigned integer that can be used to address up to 4GB --
that is, up to 4,294,967,296 memory cells. Linear addresses are usually
represented in hexadecimal notation; their values range from 0x00000000 to
0xffffffff.

physical address
================

Used to address memory cells in memory chips. They correspond to the elect-
rical signals sent along the address spins of the microprocessor to the
memory bus. Physical addresses are represented as 32-bit or 36-bit unsigned
integers.
