Segmentation Unit
=================

1. examines the TI field of the Segment Selector to determine which Descriptor
   Table stores the Segment Descriptor. This field indicates that the Descriptor
   is either in the GDT (in which case the segmentation unit gets the base linear
   address of the GDT from the gdtr register) or in the active LDT (in which
   case the segmentation units gets the base linear address of that LDT from the
   ldtr register).

2. computes the address of the Segment Descriptor from the index field of the
   Segment Selector. the index field is multiplied by 8 (the size of a segment
   descriptor), and the result is added to the content of the gdtr or ldtr
   register.

3. adds the offset of the logical address to the base field of the segment
   descriptor, thus obtaining the linear address.
