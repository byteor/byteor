 Flag name              Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 CLONE_VM               Shares the memory descriptor and all page tables.

 CLONE_FS               Shares the table that identifies the root
                        directory and the current working directory, as
                        well as the value of the bitmask used to mask the
                        initial file permissions of a new file (the so-
                        called file umask).

 CLONE_FILES            Shares the table that identifies the open files.

 CLONE_SIGHAND          Shares the tables that identify the signal
                        handlers and the blocked and pending signals. if
                        this flag is true, the CLONE_VM flag must also
                        be set.

 CLONE_PTRACE           if traced, the parent wants the child to be
                        traced too. furthermore, the debugger may want
                        to trace the child on its own; in this case, the
                        kernel forces the flat to 1.

 CLONE_VFORK            set when the system call issued is a vfork().

 CLONE_PARENT           sets the parent of the child (parent and
                        real_parent fields in the process descriptor) to
                        the parent of the calling process.

 CLONE_THREAD           inserts the child into the same thread group of
                        the parent, and forces the child to share the
                        signal descriptor of the parent. the child's tgid
                        and group_leader fields are set accordingly. if
                        this flag is true, the CLONE_SIGHAND flag must
                        also be set.

 CLONE_NEWNS            set if the clone needs its own namespace, that is,
                        its own view of the mounted filesystem; it is not
                        possible to specify both CLONE_NEWNS and CLONE_FS.

 CLONE_SYSVSEM          shares the System V IPC undoable semaphore
                        operations.

 CLONE_SETTLS           creates a new thread local storage (TLS) segment
                        for the lightweight process; the segment is
                        described in the structure pointed to by the tls
                        parameter.

 CLONE_PARENT_SETTID    write the pid of the child into the user mode
                        variable of the parent pointed to by the ptid
                        parameter.

 CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID   when set, the kernel sets up a mechanism to be
                        triggered when the child process will exit or
                        when it will start executing a new program. in
                        these cases, the kernel will clear the user mode
                        variable pointed to by the ctid parameter and
                        will awaken any process waiting for this event.

 CLONE_DETACHED         a legacy flag ignored by the kernel.

 CLONE_UNTRACED         set by the kernel to override the value of the
                        CLONE_PTRACE flag (used for disabling tracing of
                        kernel threads).

 CLONE_CHILD_SETTID     writes the PID of the child into the user mode
                        variable of the child pointed to by the ctid
                        parameter.

 CLONE_STOPPED          forces the child to start in the TASK_STOPPED
                        state.
