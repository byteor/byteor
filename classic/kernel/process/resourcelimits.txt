 Field name         Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 RLIMIT_AS          the maximum size of process address space, in bytes.
                    the kernel checks this value when the process uses
                    malloc() or a related function to enlarge its address
                    space

 RLIMIT_CORE        the maximum core dump size, in bytes. the kernel checks
                    this value when process is aborted, before creating a
                    core file in the current directory of the process. if
                    the limit is 0, the kernel won't create the file.

 RLIMIT_CPU         the maximum CPU time for the process, in seconds. if
                    the process exceeds the limit, the kernel sends it a
                    SIGXCPU signal, and then, if the process doesn't
                    terminate, the SIGKILL signal.

 RLIMIT_DATA        the maximum heap size, in bytes. the kernel checks this
                    value before expanding the heap of the process.

 RLIMIT_FSIZE       the maximum file size allowed, in bytes. if the process
                    tries to enlarge a file to a size greater than this
                    value, the kernel sends it a SIGXFSZ signal.

 RLIMIT_LOCKS       maximum number of file locks (currently, not enforced).

 RLIMIT_MEMLOCK     the maximum size of nonswappable memory, in bytes. the
                    kernel checks this value when the process tries to lock
                    a page frame in memory using the mlock() or mlockall()
                    system calls.

 RLIMIT_MSGQUEUE    maximum number of bytes in POSIX message queues.

 RLIMIT_NOFILE      the maximum number of open file descriptors. the kernel
                    checks this value when opening a new file or duplicating
                    a file descriptor.

 RLIMIT_NPROC       the maximum number of processes that the user can own.

 RLIMIT_RSS         the maximum number of page frames owned by the process (
                    currently, not enforced).

 RLIMIT_SIGPENDING  the maximum number of pending signals for the process.

 RLIMIT_STACK       the maximum stack size, in bytes. the kernel check this
                    value before expanding the User Mode stack of the process.
