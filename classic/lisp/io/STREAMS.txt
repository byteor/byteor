Streams
=======

Streams are Lisp objects representing sources and/or destinations of
characters. To read from or write to a file, you open it as a stream.
But streams are not identical with files. When you read or print at
the toplevel, you also use a stream. You can even create streams that
read from or write to strings.

By default, input is read from the stream *standard-input*. The
default place for output is *standard-output*. Initially thay will
probably be the same place: a stream representing the toplevel.

Already we have seen read and format used to read from and print to
the toplevel. The former takes an optional argument, which should be
a stream, and defaults to *standard-input*. The first argument to
format can also be a stream, but when it is t, the output is sent to
*standard-output*. So what we have been doing as far is using the
defaults. We could do the same I/O operations on any stream.
