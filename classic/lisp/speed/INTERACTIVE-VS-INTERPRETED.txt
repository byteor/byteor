LISP IS AN INTERACTIVE LANGUAGE, BUT A LANGUAGE DOES NOT HAVE TO BE INTERPRETED
TO BE INTERACTIVE. EARLY LISP IMPLEMENTATIONS WERE IMPLEMENTED BY INTERPRETERS,
AND THE IDEA AROSE THAT LISP'S UNIQUE QUALITIES DEPENDED ON ITS BEING INTERPRE-
TED. THIS IDEA IS MISTAKEN: COMMON LISP IS THE SAME LANGUAGE COMPILED AS IT IS
INTERPRETED.

AT LEAST TWO COMMON LISP IMPLEMENTATIONS DO NOT EVEN INCLUDE INTERPRETERS. IN
THESE IMPLEMENTATIONS, EXPRESSIONS TYPED INTO THE TOPLEVEL ARE COMPILED BEFORE
BEING EVALUATED. SO IT IS NOT MERELY OLD-FASHIONED TO CALL THE TOPLEVEL THE
"INTERPRETER," IT CAN BE AN ERROR OF FACT.
