SUMMARY
=======

1. Common Lisp supports arrays of at least 7 dimensions. One-dimensional
   arrays are called vectors.

2. Strings are vectors of characters. Characters are objects in their own
   right.

3. Sequences include lists and vectors. Many sequence functions take
   keyword arguments from a standard set.

4. Parsing is easy in Lisp because it has so many functions that work on
   strings.

5. Calling defstruct defines a structure named fields. It is good example
   of a program that writes programs.

6. Binary search trees are useful for maintaining a sorted collection of
   objects.

7. Hash tables provide a more efficient way to represent sets and mappings.
