// In C++ (but not C), the const modifier alters the
// default storage classes slightly. Whereas a global
// variable external linkage by default, a const global
// variable has internal linkage by default. That is,
// C++ treats a global const definition, such as in the
// folllowing code fragment, as if the static specifier
// had been used:

const int Fingers = 10; // same as static const int Fingers = 10;

int main(void)
{
    // use Finger
    return 0;
}
