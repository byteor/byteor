#1 Automatic storage duration

    Variables declared inside a function definition -- including function
  parameters -- have automatic storage duration. They are created when
  program execution enters the function or block in which they are defined,
  and the memory used for them is freed when execution leaves the function
  or block. C++ has two kinds of automatic storage duration variables.

#2 Static storage duration

    Variables defined outside a function definition or else by using the
  key word static have static storage duration. They persist for the entire
  time a program is running. C++ has three kinds of static storage duration
  variables.

#3 Thread storage duration (C++ 11)

    These days multicore processors are common. These are CPUs that can
  handle serval execution tasks simultaneously. This allows a program to
  split computations into separarate threads that can be processed conc-
  urrently. Variables declared with the thread_local keyword have storage
  that persist for as long as the containing thread lasts. This book does
  not venture into concurrent programming.

#4 Dynamic storage duration

    Memory allocated by the new operator persists until it is freed with
  the delete operator or until the program ends, whichever comes first.
  This memory has dynamic storage duration and sometimes is termed the
  free store or the heap.
