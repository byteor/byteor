** Notes

There are four reserved names for paths that should NOT be used for packages to
be built with the go tool:

- "main" denotes the top-level package in a stand-alone executable.

- "all" expands to all package directories found in the GOPATH trees. For
  example, 'go list all' lists all the packages on the local system.

- "std" is like all but expands to just the packages in the standard Go library.

- "cmd" expands to the Go repository's commands and their internal libraries,
  import path beginning with "cmd/" only match source code in the Go repository.
