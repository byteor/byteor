       cpu_frequency: CPU Frequency (Hz)
          start_time: Sample Start Time (s)
            end_time: Sample End Time (s)
        elapsed_time: Total Sample Time (s)
          theory_cps: Theory Count Per Second
            theory_c: Theory Total Count
       event_counter: How Many Count Per Event
         theory_cpse: Theory Count Per Second by Event
           theory_ce: Theory Total Count by Event
      e_sample_count: Sample Count by Event
      e_sample_ratio: Sample Ratio by Event
e_sample_count_slice: Sample Count Per Slice by Event
e_sample_ratio_slice: Sample Ratio Per Slice by Event


Formula
=======

                 1Hz = 10^6
        elapsed_time = end_time - start_time
          theory_cps = cpu_frequency * 10^6
            theory_c = theory_cps * elapsed_time
         theory_cpse = theory_cps / event_counter
           theory_ce = theory_c / event_counter
      e_sample_ratio = (e_sample_count / theory_ce) * 100%
e_sample_ratio_slice = (e_sample_count_slice / theory_cpse) * 100%
