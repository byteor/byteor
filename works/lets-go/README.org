#+TITLE: Let's Go: Golang inside and outside

* Part 1: Outside

** Introduction

#+BEGIN_SRC go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
#+END_SRC

Following conclusions can be acquired from the example:
- Source code is full UTF-8 encoded
- Golang is static typed, that means you need to compile then run
- Unlike many other static language, go code does not need semicolon to terminate a statement
- Package is the smallest public module
- Public/Private is controlled by Uppercase or Lowercase, like =Println= is public

Let's build and run the example:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
go run hello.go
Hello, 世界
#+END_SRC
