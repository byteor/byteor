#+TITLE: Let's Go: Golang inside and outside
#+AUTHOR: Zhou Peng

* Part 1: Outside

** Introduction

#+BEGIN_SRC go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
        fmt.Println("Hello, 世界")
}
#+END_SRC

Following conclusions can be made:
- Source code is full UTF-8 encoded
- Golang is static typed, that means you need to compile then run
- Unlike many other static language, go code does not need semicolon to terminate a statement
- Package is the smallest public module
- Public/Private is controlled by Uppercase or Lowercase, like =Println= is public

Let's build and run the example:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
go run hello.go
Hello, 世界
#+END_SRC

** Language Elements

*** Golang has only 25 keywords

|          |             |        |           |        |
|----------+-------------+--------+-----------+--------|
| break    | default     | func   | interface | select |
| case     | defer       | go     | map       | struct |
| chan     | else        | goto   | package   | switch |
| const    | fallthrough | if     | range     | type   |
| continue | for         | import | return    | var    |

*** And 36 builtin functions or types

|        |         |         |         |        |         |           |            |         |
|--------+---------+---------+---------+--------+---------+-----------+------------+---------|
| append | bool    | byte    | cap     | close  | complex | complex64 | complex128 | uint16  |
| copy   | false   | float32 | float64 | imag   | int     | int8      | int16      | uint32  |
| int32  | int64   | iota    | len     | make   | new     | nil       | panic      | uint64  |
| print  | println | real    | recover | string | true    | uint      | uint8      | uintptr |

*** Difference between keywords and builtins

In one word, =builtins= are just predefined functions or types by the go
compiler, which can be redefined by users for other purpose, but =keywords= can
only be used as the =language spec= explained.

*** Keywords grouped by their mainly used cases

Golang =array= details:
- Array's memory is allocated as a whole, which makes array access much more efficient
- Array's length is part of array type, which means =[5]int= does equal to =[2]int=

Golang =slice= details:
- Slice is just a descriptor of an array, consists of 3 parts: =ptr= to
  underling memory block, =len= length of current slice, =cap= the underline
  memory block capabilities.
- So copy slice is just copy 3 small integers, but copy array is copy the whole
  memory block, which makes slice much more useful in many situations.
