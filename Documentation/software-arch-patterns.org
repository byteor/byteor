Understanding Common Architecture Patterns and When to Use Them

* Layered Architecture

** Overall agility

Rating: Low
Analysis: Overall agility is the ability to respond quickly to a constantly
changing environment. While change can be isolated through the layers of
isolation feature of this pattern, it is still cumbersome and time-consuming to
make changes in this architecture pattern because of the monolithic nature of
most implementations as well as the tight coupling of components usually found
with this pattern.

** Ease of deployment

Rating: Low
Analysis: Depending on how you implement this pattern, deployment can become an
issue, particularly for larger applications. One small change to a component can
require a redeployment of the entire application (or a large portion of the
application), resulting in deployments that need to be planned, scheduled, and
executed during off-hours or on weekends. As such, this pattern does not easily
lend itself toward a continuous delivery pipeline, further reducing the overall
rating for deployment.

** Testability

Rating: High
Analysis: Because components belong to specific layers in the architecture,
other layers can be mocked or stubbed, making this pattern is relatively easy to
test. A developer can mock a presentation component or screen to isolate testing
withing a business component, as well as mock the business layer to test certain
screen functionality.

** Performance

Rating: Low
Analysis: While it is true some layered architecture can perform well, the
pattern does not lend itself to high-performance application due to the
inefficiencies of having to go through multiple layers of the architecture to
fulfill a business request.

** Scalability

Rating: Low
Analysis: Because of the trend toward tightly coupled and monolithic
implementations of this pattern, applications build using this architecture
pattern are generally difficult to scale. You can scale a layered architecture
by splitting the layers into separate physical deployments or replicating the
entire application into multiple nodes, but overall the granularity is too
broad, making it expensive to scale.

** Ease of development

Rating: High
Analysis: Ease of development gets a relatively high score, mostly because this
pattern is so well known and is not overly complex to implement. Because most
companies develop applications by separating skill sets by layers (presentation,
business, database), this pattern becomes a natural choice for most
business-application development. The connection between a company's
communication and organization structure and the way it develops software is
outlined is what is called Conway's law.

* Event-Driven Architecture

- Mediator Topology

The mediator topology is useful for events that have multiple steps and require
some level of orchestration to process the event.

- Broker Topology

The broker topology differs from the mediator topology in that there is no
central event mediator; rather, the message flow is distributed across the event
processor components in a chain-like fashion through a lightweight message
broker.

** Overall agility

Rating: High
Analysis: Overall agility is the ability to respond quickly to a constantly
changing environment. Since event-processor components are single-purpose and
completely decoupled from other event processor components, changes are
generally isolated to one or few event processors and can be made quickly
without impacting other components.

** Ease of deployment

Rating: High
Analysis: Overall this pattern is relatively easy to deploy due to the decoupled
nature of the event-processor components. The broker topology tends to be easier
to deploy than the mediator topology, primarily because the event mediator
component is somewhat tightly coupled to the event processors: a change in an
event processor component might also require a change in the event mediator,
requiring both to be deployed for any given change.

** Testability

Rating: Low
Analysis: While individual unit testing is not overly difficult, it does require
some sort of specialized testing client or testing tool to generate events.
Testing is also complicated by the asynchronous nature of this pattern.

** Performance

Rating: High
Analysis: While it is certainly possible to implement an event-driven
architecture that does not perform well due to all the messaging infrastructure
involved, in general, the pattern achieves high performance through its
asynchronous capabilities; in other words, the ability to perform decoupled,
parallel asynchronous operations outweighs the cost of queuing and dequeuing
messages.

** Scalability

Rating: High
Analysis: Scalability is naturally achieved in this pattern through highly
independent and decoupled event processors. Each event processor can be scaled
separately, allowing for fine-grained scalability.

** Ease of development

Rating: Low
Analysis: Development can be somewhat complicated due to the asynchronous nature
of the pattern as well as contract creation and the need for more advanced error
handling conditions within the code for unresponsive event processors and failed
brokers.
