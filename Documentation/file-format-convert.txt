Scenario
========

Git server deployed on a remote Linux server, Developers work on Windows pc.
developers start work, pull from remote Linux server, checkout feature br-
anch, get work done, merge feature branch to local develop branch, push local
develop branch to remote Linux Git Server.

Problems may happen, git server store file using \n line ending, some windows
IDE (like VS, Pycharm) change all project files to windows line ending \r\n
in the background, user can't stop it. At this time, git status will prompt
you that some files changed (status mostly delete all then add all line), but
you change nothing. That's the line ending character has been changed.

Solution
========

Unity Windows/Unix/Mac line ending character

HOW-TO
======

Linux/Unix

find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 file | grep -P text | cut -d: -f1 | xargs dos2unix
