CONTEXT-FREE GRAMMAR (CFG)
--------------------------

A context-free grammar is a 4-tuple (V,Σ,R,S), where

1. V is a finite set called the variables,
2. Σ is a finite set, disjoint from V, called the terminals,
3. R is a finite set of rules, with each rule being a variable and a string of variables and terminals, and
4. S ∈ V is the start variable.
