FINITE AUTOMATA
---------------

Let M = (Q,Σ,δ,q0,F) be a finite automaton and let w = w1w2···wn be a
string where each wi is a member of the alphabet Σ. Then M accepts w
if a sequence of states r0,r1,...,rn in Q exists with three
conditions:

1. r0 = q0,
2. δ(ri, wi+1) = ri+1, for i=0, ..., n−1, and
3. rn ∈ F.

A language is called a regular language if some finite automaton
recognizes it.


REGULAR OPERATIONS
------------------

Let A and B be languages. We define the regular operations union,
concatenation, and star as follows:

• Union: A ∪ B = {x| x ∈ A or x ∈ B}.
• Concatenation: A ◦ B = {xy| x ∈ A and y ∈ B}.
• Star: A∗ = {x1x2...xk| k ≥ 0 and each xi ∈ A}.


NONDETERMINISTIC FINITE AUTOMATON
---------------------------------

A nondeterministic finite automaton is a 5-tuple (Q,Σ,δ,q0,F), where

1. Q is a finite set of states,
2. Σ is a finite alphabet,
3. δ: Q × Σε −→ P(Q) is the transition function,
4. q0 ∈ Q is the start state, and
5. F ⊆ Q is the set of accept states.
