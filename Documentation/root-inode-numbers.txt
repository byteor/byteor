Root inode numbers
==================

The inode number for the root directory of a filesystem is always 2.
Why is that? The answer has to do with both technology and history.

A directory entry with an inode number of zero indicates an unused,
or empty, slot. So inode 0 cannot be used for a real file or directory.

OK, so what about inode 1? Well, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s,
disks were not as well made as they are now. When you bought a disk,
it came with a list of bad blocks -- known locations on the disk that
were not usable. Each operating system had to have to keep track of
those blocks and avoid using them.

Under Unix, you did this by creating a special-purpose file, whose data
blocks were the ones known to be bad. This file was attached on inode
1, leaving inode 2 as the first inode usable for regular files or
directories.

Modern disk drives have considerable built-in electronics and handle
bad blocks on their own. Thus, technically, it would be feasible to
use inode 1 for a file. However, since so much Unix software assumes
that inode 2 is the inode for filesystem root directories. Linux follows
this convention as well. (However, Linux sometimes uses inode 1 for
nonnative filesystems, such as vfat or /proc.)
