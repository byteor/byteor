# Device

- Character Devices (chrdev)

Deliver a continuous stream of data that applications read sequentially;
generally, random access is not possible. Instead, such devices allow data to be
read and written byte-by-byte or character-by-character. Modems are classical
examples of character devices.

- Block Devices (blkdev)

Allow applications to address their data randomly and to freely select the
position at which they want to read data. Typical block devices are hard disks
because applications can address any position on the disk from which to read
data. Also, data can be read or written only in multiples of block units
(usually 512 bytes); character-based addressing, as in character devices, is not
possible.
