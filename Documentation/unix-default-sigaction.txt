[Termination]

    The process is terminated.

[Ignored]

    The signal is ignored, the program is never aware that anything happened.

[Core dump]

    The process is terninated, and the kernel creates a core file (in the
    process's current directory) containing the image of running program at
    the time the signal arrived. The core dump can be used later with a
    debugger for examination of the state of the program.

    By default, GNU/Linux systems create files named core.pid, where pid is
    the process ID of the killed process.

[Stopped]

    The process is stopped, it may be continued later. (If you've used shell
    job control with CTRL-Z, fg, and bg, you understood stopping a procss.)
