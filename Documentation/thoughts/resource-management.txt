Function-Based vs Block-Based Resource Management
=================================================

Block-Based:

  Traditional C-family language management resource based on block
  scoped. Like C++, you can use {} to define a block, compiler will
  automatically alloc object declared in this block and free object
  before block end.

  If you have object corss mutiple blocks, this object must be managed
  by programmer explicitly.

Function-Based:

  Golang's defer is function blocked resource managment primitives,
  that means the language ensures that object managemented by it is
  ensured no matter how the function returned (normally, panic, break).
