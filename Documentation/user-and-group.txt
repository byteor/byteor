See `grep root /etc/passwd`
==========================

The User Name
-------------

This is what the user types to log in, what shows up for
'ls -l' and in any others context that displays users.

The password field
------------------

On older systems, this is the user's encrypted password.
On newer systems, this field is likely to be an x (as shown),
meaning that the password information is held in a different
file. This separation is a security measure; if the encrypted
passwd isn't available to nonprivileged users, it is much
harder to "crack".

The User ID Number
------------------

This should be unique; one number per user.

The Group ID Number
-------------------

This is the user's initial group ID number. on modern
systems processes have multiple groups associated with them.

The User's Real Name
--------------------

This is at least a first and last name. Some system allow
for comma-separated fields, for office location, phone
number, and so on, but this is not standardized.

The Login Directory
-------------------

This directory becomes the home directory for users when
they log in ($HOME - the default for the cd command).

The Login Program
-----------------

The program to run when the user logins in. This is usually
a shell, but it need not be.  If this is left empty, the
default is /bin/sh.

See `grep root /etc/group`
=========================

The Group Name
--------------

This is the name of the group, as shown in 'ls -l' or in
any other context in which a group name is needed.

The Group Password
------------------

This field is historical. It is no longer used.


The Group ID Number
-------------------

As with the user ID, this should be unique to each group.

The User List
-------------

This is comma-separated list of users who are members of the group.

Data Structure
--------------

struct passwd {
    char *pw_name;   /* user name */
    char *pw_passwd; /* user password */
    uid_t pw_uid;    /* user id */
    gid_t pw_gid;    /* group id */
    char *pw_gecos;  /* real name */
    char *pw_dir;    /* home directory */
    char *pw_shell;  /* shell program */
};

struct group {
    char *gr_name;   /* group name */
    char *gr_passwd; /* group password */
    char gr_gid;     /* group id */
    char **gr_mem;   /* group members */
};

NOTE:

The pointers returned by getpwent(), getpwnam(), and pwuid()
all point to internal static data. Thus, you should make a copy
of their contents if you need to save the information.

The members that represent character strings are pointers; they
too point at internal static data. and if you're going to copy
the structure, make sure to copy the data each member points to
as well.
