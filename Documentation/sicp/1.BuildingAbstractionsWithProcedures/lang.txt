Every powerful language has three mechanisms for accomplishing this:

  1. primitive expressions, which represent the simplest entities the
     language is concerned with,

  2. means of combination, by which compound elements are built from
     simpler ones, and

  3. means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and
     manipulated as units.
