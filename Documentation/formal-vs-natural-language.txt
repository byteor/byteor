Formal vs Natural Language
==========================

Ambiguity
---------

Natural languages are full of ambiguity, which people deal with by using
contextual clues and other information. Formal languages are designed to be
nearly or completely unambiguous, which means that any statement has exactly one
meaning, regardless of context.

Redundancy
----------

In order to make up for ambiguity and reduce misunderstandings, natural
languages employ lots of redundancy. As a result, they are often verbose. Formal
languages are less redundant and more concise.

Literalness
-----------

Natural languages are full of idiom and metaphor. If I say, “The penny dropped,”
there is probably no penny and nothing dropping (this idiom means that someone
realized something after a period of confusion). Formal languages mean exactly
what they say.

Poetry
------

Words are used for their sounds as well as for their meaning, and the whole poem
together creates an effect or emotional response. Ambiguity is not only common
but often deliberate.

Prose
-----

The literal meaning of words is more important, and the structure contributes
more meaning. Prose is more amenable to analysis than poetry but still often
ambiguous.

Programs
--------

The meaning of a computer program is unambiguous and literal, and can be
understood entirely by analysis of the tokens and structure.
