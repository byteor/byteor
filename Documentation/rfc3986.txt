# Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)

## Syntax

The generic URI syntax consists of a hierarchical sequence of
components referred to as the scheme, authority, path, query, and
fragment.

   URI         = scheme ":" hier-part [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ]

   hier-part   = "//" authority path-abempty
                / path-absolute
                / path-rootless
                / path-empty

The scheme and path components are required, though the path may be
empty (no characters).  When authority is present, the path must
either be empty or begin with a slash ("/") character.  When authority
is not present, the path cannot begin with two slash characters
("//").  These restrictions result in five different ABNF rules for a
path, only one of which will match any given URI reference.

The following are two example URIs and their component parts:

      foo://example.com:8042/over/there?name=ferret#nose
      \_/   \______________/\_________/ \_________/ \__/
       |           |            |            |        |
    scheme     authority       path        query   fragment
       |   _____________________|__
      / \ /                        \
      urn:example:animal:ferret:nose
