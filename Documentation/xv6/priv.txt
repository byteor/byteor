# Privileged Architecture

More-privileged modes generally have access to all of the features of
less-privileged modes, and they add additional functionality not
available to less-privileged modes, such as the ability to handle
interrupts and perform I/O. Processors typically spend most of their
execution time in their least-privileged mode; interrupts and
exceptions transfer control to more-privileged modes.

## Machine Mode

Five kind of synchronous exceptions can happen during M-mode execution:

1. Access fault exceptions arise when a physical memory address
   doesn't support the access type - for example, attempting to store
   to a ROM.

2. Breakpoint exceptions arise from executing an ebreak instruciton,
   or when an address or datum matches a debug trigger.

3. Environment call exceptions arise from executing an ecall
   instruction.

4. Illegal instruction exceptions result from decoding an invalid opcode.

5. Misaligned address exceptions occur when the effective address
   isn't divisible by the access size - for example, amoadd.w with an
   address of 0x12.

RISC-V exception and interrupt causes. The most-significant bit of
mcause is set to 1 for interrupts or 0 for synchronous exceptions, and
the least-significant bits identify the interrupt or
exception. Supervisor interrupts and page-fault exceptions are only
possible when supervisor mode is implemented (XLEN is 32 for RV32 or
64 for RV64).

Eight control and status register (CSRs) are integral to machine-mode
exception handling:

* mtvec, Machine Trap Vector, holds the address the processor jumps to
         when an exception occurs.

* mepc, Machine Exception PC, points to the instruction where the
        exception occurred.

* mcause, Machine Exception Cause, indicates which exception occurred.

* mie, Machine Interrupt Enable, lists which interrupts the processor
       can take and which it must ignore.

* mip, Machine Interrupt Pending, lists the interrupts currently
       pending.

* mtval, Machine Trap Value, holds additional trap information; the
         faulting address for address exceptions, the instruction
         itself for illegal instruction exceptions; and zero for other
         exceptions.

* mscratch, Machine Scratch, holds one world of data for temporary
            storage.

* mstatus, Machine Status, holds the global interrupt enable, along
           with a plethora of other state.

When a hart takes an exception, the hardware atomically undergoes
several state transitions:

1. The PC of the exceptional instruction is preserved in mepc, and the
   PC is set to mtvec. (For synchronous exceptions, mepc points to the
   instruction that caused the exception; for interrupts, it points
   where execution should resume after the interrupt is handled.)

2. mcause is set to the exception cause, and mtval is set to the
   faulting address or some other exception-specific word of
   information.

3. Interrupts are disabled by setting MIE=0 in the mstatus CSR, and
   the previous value of MIE is preserved in MPIE.

4. The pre-exception privilege mode is preserved in mstatus' MPP
   field, and the privilege mode is changed to M. (If the processor
   only implements M-mode, this step is effectively skipped.)

To avoid overwriting the contents of the integer registers, the
prologue of an interrupt handler usually begins by swapping an integer
register (say, a0) with the mscratch CSR.  Usually, the software will
have arranged for mscratch to contain a pointer to additional
in-memory scratch space, which the handler uses to save as many
integer registers as its body will use. After the body executes, the
epilogue of an interrupt handler restores the registers it saved to
memory, then again swaps a0 with mscratch, restoring both registers to
their pre-exception values. Finally, the handler returns with mret, an
instruction unique to M-mode. mret sets the PC to mepc, restores the
previous interrupt-enable setting by copying the mstatus MPIE field to
MIE, and sets the privilege mode to the value in mstatus’ MPP field,
essentially reversing the actions described in the preceding
paragraph.
