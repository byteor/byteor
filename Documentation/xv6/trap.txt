When it needs to force a trap, the RISC-V hardware does the following
for all trap types (other than timer interrupts).

1. If the trap is a device interrupt, and the `sstatus' SIE bit is
   clear, don't do any of the following.

2. Disable interrupts by clearing the `SIE' bit in sstatus.

3. Copy the `pc' to `sepc'.

4. Save the current mode (user or supervisor) in the `SPP' bit in
   `sstatus'.

5. Set `scause' to reflect the trap's cause.

6. Set the mode to supervisor.

7. Copy `stvec' to the `pc'.

8. Start executing at the new `pc'.
