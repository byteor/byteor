** Notes

C language switch case matched will fall through to the next case statement by
default, which leads to many bugs.

Golang has the more natural behavior that you must explicitly use *fallthrough*
key word to flow to the next case statement.

Both C and Go switch *default* case will be matched last no matter where it is
placed.
