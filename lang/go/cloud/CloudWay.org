* Favor Simplicity

Favor simplicity in everything that you do.

** Is your IDE optional?
** Can you build and deploy from the command line?
** Can a new team member quickly figure out what's goning on just by reading the code?

* Test First, Test Everything

** Employ Test-Driven Development. Test everything, everywhere.
** Fear is the direct result of lack of testing.

* Release Early, Release Often

** Every checkin is a potential production release, deployed via CD pipeline.

* Automate Everyting

** Everything that can be automated, should be automated.
** Anything you do more than once per day is a candidate for automation.
** Any frequently repeated part of your process that cannot be replaced with a button or a script is too complicated, too brittle, or both.

* Build Service Ecosystems

** Everything is a service, including your application
