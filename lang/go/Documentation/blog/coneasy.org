* If you have to wait for the result of an operation, it's easier to do it yourself.

* Release locks and semaphores in the reverse order you acquired them.

* Channels aren't resources like files or sockets, you don't need to close them to free them.

* Acquire semaphores when you're ready to use them.

* Avoid mixing anonymous functions and goroutines.

* Before you start a goroutine, always know when, and how, it will stop.
