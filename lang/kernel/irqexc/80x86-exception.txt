================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 IRQ NO.   Exception       Description                    Exception handler        Signal
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 0         Divide error    Raised when a program issues   divide_error()           SIGFPE
                           an integer division by 0.

 1         Debug           Raised when the flag of        debug()                  SIGTRAP
                           eflags is set (quite usefull
                           to implement single-step
                           execution of a debugged
                           program) or when the address
                           of an instruction or operand
                           falls within the range of an
                           active debug register.

 2         NMI             Reserved for nonmaskable       nmi()                    None
                           interrupts (those that use
                           the NMI pin).

 3         Breakpoint      Caused by an int3              int3()                   SIGTRAP
                           (breakpoint) instruction
                           (usually inserted by a
                           debugger).

 4         Overflow        An into (check for overflow)   overflow()               SIGSEGV
                           instruction has been
                           executed while the OF
                           (overflow) flag of eflags is
                           set.

 5         Bounds check    A bound (check on address      bounds()                 SIGSEGV
                           bound) instruction is
                           executed with the operand
                           outside of the valid address
                           bounds.

 6         Invalid opcode  The CPU execution unit has     invalid_op()             SIGILL
                           detected an invalid opcode
                           (the part of the machine
                           instruction that determines
                           the operation performed).

 7         Device not      An ESCAPE, MMX, or SSE/SSE2    device_not_available()   None
           available       instruction has been
                           executed with the TS flag of
                           cr0 set.

 8         Double fault    Normally, when the CPU         doublefault_fn()         None
                           detects an exception while
                           trying to call the handler
                           for a prior execption, the
                           two exceptions can be
                           handled serially. In a few
                           cases, however, the
                           processor cannot handle
                           them serially, so it raises
                           this exception.

 9         Coprocessor     Problems with the external     copressor_segment_overrun() SIGFPE
           segment overrun mathematical coprocessor
                           (applies only to old 80386
                           microprocessors).

 10        Invalid TSS     The CPU has attempted a
                           context switch to a process    invalid_TSS()            SIGSEGV
                           having an invalid Task State
                           Segment.

 11        Segment not     A reference was made to a      segment_not_present()    SIGBUS
           present         segment not present in m
                           emory (one in which the
                           Segment-Present flag of the
                           Segment Descriptor was
                           cleared).

 12        Stack segment   The instruction attempted      stack_segment()          SIGBUS
           fault           to exceed the stack segment
                           limit, or the segment
                           identified by ss is not
                           present in memory.

 13        General         One of the protection rules    general_protection()     SIGSEGV
           protection      in the protected mode of
                           the 80x86 has been violated.

 14        Page Fault      The addressed page is not      page_fault()             SIGSEGV
                           present in memory, the
                           corresponding Page Table
                           entry is null, or a
                           violation of the paging
                           protection mechanism has
                           occurred.

 15        Intel-reserved                                 None                     None

 16        Floating-point  The floating-point unit        copressor_error()        SIGFPE
           error           integrated into the CPU
                           chip has signaled an error
                           condition, such as numeric
                           overflow or division by 0.

 17        Alignment check The address of an operand      alignment_check()        SIGBUS
                           is not correctly aligned
                           (for instance, the address
                           of a long integer is not a
                           multiple of 4).

 18        Machine check   A machine-check mechanism      machine_check()          None
                           has detected a CPU or bus
                           error.

 19        SIMD floating   The SSE or SSE2 unit           simd_copressor_error()   SIGFPE
           point exception integrated in the CPU
                           chip has signaled an
                           error condition on a
                           floating-point operation.
