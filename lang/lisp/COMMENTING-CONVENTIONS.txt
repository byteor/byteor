Commenting Conventions
======================

In Common Lisp code, anything following a semicolon is treated as
a comment. Some Lisp programmers use multiple semicolons to indicate
the level of the comment: four semicolons in a heading, three in a
description of a function or macro, two to explain the line below,
and one when a comment is on the same line as the code it applies
to. Using this convention, for example:

;;;; Utilities for operations on sorted vectors.

;;; Finds an element in a sorted vector.

(defun bin-search (obj vec)
  (let ((len (length vec)))
    ;; if a real vector, send it to finder
    (and (not (zerop len)) ; returns nil if empty
         (finder obj vec 0 (- len 1)))))
