SUMMARY
=======

1. Common Lisp has three basic block constructs: progn; block, which
   allows returns; and tagbody, which allows gotos. Many built-in
   operators have implicit blocks.

2. Entering a new lexical context is conceptually equivalent to a
   function call.

3. Common Lisp provides conditionals suited to various situations.
   All can be defined in terms of if.

4. There is a similar variety of operators for iterations.

5. Expressions can return multiple values.

6. Computations can be interrupted, and protected against the conse-
   quences of interruption.
