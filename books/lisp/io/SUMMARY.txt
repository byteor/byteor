Summary
=======

1. Streams are sources of input or destinations of output. In character
   streams, the input and output consists of characters.

2. The default stream points to the toplevel. New streams can be made by
   opening files.

3. You can get input as parsed objects, as strings of characters, or as
   individual characters.

4. The format function provides elaborate control over output.

5. To substitute one string for another in a text file, you have to read
   characters into a buffer.

6. When read encounters a macro character like ', it calls the associated
   functions.
