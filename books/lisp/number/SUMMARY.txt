Summary
=======

1. Common Lisp provides integers, ratios, floating-point numbers, and
   complex numbers.

2. Numbers can be simplified and converted, and their components can
   be extracted.

3. Predicates for comparing numbers take any number of arguments, and
   compare successive pairs ---- except /=, which compares all pairs.

4. Common Lisp provides roughly the numerical functions you might see
   on a low-end scientific calculator. The same functions generally
   apply to numbers of several types.

5. Fixnums are integers small enough to fit in one word. The are
   quietly but expensively converted to bignums when necessary. Common
   Lisp provides for up to four types of floating-point number. The
   limits of each representation are implementation-dependent constants.

6. A ray-tracer generates an image by tracing the light that makes
   each pixel back into a simulated world.
