Syntax of asm Assembler Instructions
====================================

    asm("shrl $8, %0" : "=r" (answer) : "r" (operand) : "cc");

The keyword asm is followed by a parenthetic expression consisting of
sections separated by colons. The first section contains an assembler
instruction and its operands. In this example, shrl right-shifts the
bits in its first operand. Its first operand is represented by %0. Its
second operand is the immediate constant $8.

The second section specifies the outputs.The instruction’s one output
will be placed in the C variable answer, which must be an lvalue.The
string “=r” contains an equals sign indicating an output operand and
an r indicating that answer is stored in a register.

The third section specifies the inputs.The C variable operand specifies
the value to shift. The string “r” indicates that it is stored in a
register but omits an equals sign because it is an input operand, not
an output operand.

The fourth section indicates that the instruction changes the value in
the condition code cc register.
