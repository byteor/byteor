Character Device
================

A hardware device that reads or writes a serial stream of data bytes.
Serial and parallel ports, tape drives, terminal devices, and sound
cards are examples of character devices.

Block Device
============

A hardware device that reads or writes data in fixed-size blocks. Unlike
a character device, a block device provides random access to data stored
on the device. A disk is an example of a block device.
