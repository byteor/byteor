Name                Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 SIGINT             Linux sends a process this signal when the user tries to
                    end it by pressing CTRL+C

 SIGILL             A process gets this signal when it attempts to execute
                    an illegal instruction. This could indicate that the
                    program's stack is corrupted.

SIGABRT             The abort function causes the process to receive this
                    signal.

SIGFPE              The process has executed an invalid floating-point math
                    instruction. Depending on how the CPU is configured, an
                    invalid floating-point operation may return a special
                    non-number value such as inf (infinity) or NaN (not a
                    number) instead of raising SIGFPE.

SIGKILL             This signal ends a process immediately and cannot be
                    handled.

SIGUSR1             This signal is reserved for application use.

SIGUSR2             This signal is reserved for application user.

SIGSEGV             The program attempted an invalid memory access. The
                    asscess may be to an address that is invalid in the
                    process's virtual memory space, or the access may be
                    forbidden by the target memory's permissions. Dereferencing
                    a "whild pointer" can cause a SIGSEGV.

SIGPIPE             The program has attempted to access a broken data stream,
                    such as a socket connection that has been closed by the
                    other party.

SIGALRM             The alarm system call schedules the dielivery of this signal
                    at a later time.

SIGTERM             This signal requests that a process terminate. This is the
                    default signal sent by kill command.

SIGCHLD             Linux sends a process this signal when a child process exits.

SIGXCPU             Linux sends a process this signal when it exceeds the limit
                    of CPU time that it can consume.

SIGVTALRM           The setitimer schedules the delivery of this signal at a
                    future time.
