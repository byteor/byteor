# Slab Cache

1. For frequently used objects, the kernel defines its own cache that contains
   only instances of the desired type. Each time one of the objects is required,
   it can be quickly removed from the cache (and returned there after use); the
   slab cache automatically takes care of interaction with the buddy system and
   requests new page frames when the existing caches are full.

2. For the general allocation of smaller memory blocks, the kernel defines a set
   of slab caches for various object sizes that it can access using the same
   functions with which we are familiar from userspace programming; a prefixed k
   indicates that these functions are associated with the kernel: kmalloc and
   kfree.
