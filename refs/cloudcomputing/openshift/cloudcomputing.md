# Definition of cloud computing

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

The capability provided to the consumer is to use the providerâ€™s applications
running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various
client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser
(e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or
control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers,
operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with
the possible exception of limited user-specific application configuration
settings.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud
infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using
programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure
including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over
the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the
application-hosting environment.

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage,
networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able
to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and
applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed
applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components
(e.g., host firewalls).
