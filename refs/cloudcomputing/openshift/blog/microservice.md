# Microservice

Application characteristics:

  1. It can be accessed as a browser-based application or a mobile application.
     It should be usable in whatever interaction model your customers desire.

  2. It involves user-interaction which updates the experience in real-time. It
     should represent an engaging experience for the customer.

  3. All user interactions are tracked and stored in real time and based on
     those interactions, the system will apply business logic to personalize the
     experience. We (the business) want to learn from the customers’
     interactions and improve the experience over time. We also want to better
     learn about how the customer engages with our business.

  4. Both the technology teams and the business teams have visibility into the
     data coming from the user-interactions. This is a “digital experience” and
     one where the business leaders must work closely with the technology
     leaders to get from “idea” to “execution”.

  5. The application must have the ability to be frequently updated in order to
     add new features or be modified to adjust the experience based on
     interaction data. The business is no longer going to predict the future
     12-18 months in advance. Instead, it must be able to quickly adjust to the
     changing expectations of the customer.

The core of all modern applications:

  1. *The API is the product.* An API is a way to represent a business service
     as a programmable interface. While parts of an application may live in a
     local client, the core elements should be interacting with a set of APIs in
     the backend. This allows user flexibility, and broader opportunities to
     integrate with 3rd-party applications or partners.

  2. *Ops are the COGS.* For a digital product or service, the on-going
     operational costs are the COGS (Costs of Goods Sold). Being able to
     optimize those COGS is a critical element to making this digital product a
     success. Businesses can differentiate their digital services on user
     experience, as well as closely controlled the cost to operate those
     services.

  3. *Data Feedback Loops.* It’s critical to collect insight into how customers
     interact with the business digitally, and this data must be shared across
     technical and business team to help constantly improve the product. In the
     digital world, strategy is a constantly evolving model that requires
     data-driven insights.

  4. *Rapidly Build and Test.* If the digital experience for a customer is now a
     software service, it is important for the business to be able to build that
     software (applications) quickly and with high quality. Systems must be in
     place to enable both speed and the quality. This is called continuous
     integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD).

  5. *Automated Deployments.* Once the application has been built (or updated)
     and tested, then it’s critical to be able to deliver it to the customer
     quickly and in a repeatable manner. Automation not only makes that process
     repeatable (and more secure), but it helps with the goal of reducing the
     Ops COGS.
