- Identify and select archetypes and teams

- Analyze and prioritize individual applications/teams

  1. automated code build process
  2. ability to externalize configuration (outside source code)
  3. not heavily reliant on specific ip/port bindings
  4. can run on current rhel compatible libraries
  5. ability to log to console/stdout
