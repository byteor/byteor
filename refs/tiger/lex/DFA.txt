FINITE AUTOMATA
---------------

A finite automation has a finite set of states; edges lead from one state to
another, and each edge is labeled with a symbol. One state is the start state,
and certain of the states are distinguished as final states.

In a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), no two edges leaving from the same
state are labeled with the same symbol. A DFA accepts or rejects a string as
follows. Starting in the start state, for each character in the input string the
automaton follows exactly one edge to get to the next state. The edge must be
labeled with the input character. After making n transitions for an n-character
string, if the automaton is in a final state, then it accepts the string. If it
is not in a final state, or if at some point there was no appropriately labeled
edge to follow, it rejects. The language recognized by an automaton is the set
of strings that it accepts.
