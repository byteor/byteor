Regular Expression
==================

Symbol
------

For each symbol a in the alphabet of the language, the regular expression a
denotes the language containing just the string a.

Alternation
-----------

Given two regular expressions M and N, the alternation operator written as a
vertical bar | makes a new regular expression M | N. A string is in the language
of M | N if it is in the language of M or in the language of N. Thus, the
language of a | b contains the two strings a and b.

Concatenation
-------------

Given two regular expressions M and N, the concatenation operator · makes a new
regular expression M · N. A string is in the language of M · N if it is the
concatenation of any two strings α and β such that α is in the language of M
and β is in the language of N. Thus, the regular expression (a | b) · a defines
the language containing the two strings aa and ba.

Epsilon
-------

The regular expression ε represents a language whose only string is the empty
string. Thus, (a · b) | ε represents the language { "" , "ab" }.

Repetition
----------

Given a regular expression M, its Kleene closure is M∗ . A string is in M∗ if
it is the concatenation of zero or more strings, all of which are in M. Thus,
((a | b) · a) ∗ represents the infinite set { "" , "aa" , "ba" , "aaaa" , "baaa"
, "aaba" , "baba" , "aaaaaa" , . . . }.
