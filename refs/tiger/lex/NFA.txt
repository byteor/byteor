NONDETERMINISTIC FINITE AUTOMATA
--------------------------------

A nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) is one that has a choice of edges –
labeled with the same symbol – to follow out of a state. Or it may have special
edges labeled with ε (the Greek letter epsilon), that can be followed without
eating any symbol from the input.
