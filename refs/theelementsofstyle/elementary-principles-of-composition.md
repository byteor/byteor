# Elementary Principles of Composition

## 12. Choose a suitable design and hold to it

A basic structural design underlies every kind of writing. Writers will in part
follow this design, in part deviate from it, according to their skills, their
needs, and the unexpected events that accompany the act of composition. Writing,
to be effective, must follow closely the thoughts of the writer, but not
necessarily in the order in which those thoughts occur.

This calls for a scheme of procedure. In some cases, the best design is no
design, as with a love letter, which is simply an outpouring, or with a casual
essay, which is a ramble. But in most cases, planning must be a deliberate
prelude to writing. The first principle of composition, therefore, is to foresee
or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.

A sonnet is built on a fourteen-line frame, each line containing five feet.
Hence, sonneteers know exactly where they are headed, although they may not know
how to get there. Most forms of composition are less clearly defined, more
flexible, but all have skeletons to which the writer bring the flesh and the
blood. The more clearly the writer perceives the shape, the better are the
chances of success.
