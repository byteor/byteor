# Elementary Principles of Composition

## 12. Choose a suitable design and hold to it

A basic structural design underlies every kind of writing. Writers will in part
follow this design, in part deviate from it, according to their skills, their
needs, and the unexpected events that accompany the act of composition. Writing,
to be effective, must follow closely the thoughts of the writer, but not
necessarily in the order in which those thoughts occur.

This calls for a scheme of procedure. In some cases, the best design is no
design, as with a love letter, which is simply an outpouring, or with a casual
essay, which is a ramble. But in most cases, planning must be a deliberate
prelude to writing. The first principle of composition, therefore, is to foresee
or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.

A sonnet is built on a fourteen-line frame, each line containing five feet.
Hence, sonneteers know exactly where they are headed, although they may not know
how to get there. Most forms of composition are less clearly defined, more
flexible, but all have skeletons to which the writer bring the flesh and the
blood. The more clearly the writer perceives the shape, the better are the
chances of success.

## 13. Make the paragraph the unit of composition

The paragraph is a convenient unit; it serves all forms of literary work. As
long as it holds together, a paragraph may be of any length — a single, short
sentence or a passage of great duration.

If the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent, or if you intend to
treat it briefly, there may be no need to divide it into topics. Thus, a brief
description, a brief book review, a brief account of a single incident, a
narrative merely outlining an action, the setting forth of a single idea — any
one of these is best written in a single paragraph. After the paragraph has been
written, examine it to see whether division will improve it.

Ordinarily, however, a subject requires division into topics, each of which
should be dealt with in a paragraph. The object of treating each topic in a
paragraph by itself is, of course, to aid the reader. The beginning of each
paragraph is a signal that a new step in the development of the subject has been
reached.

As a rule, single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs. An
exception may be made of sentences of transition, indicating the relation
between the parts of an exposition or argument

In dialogue, each speech, even if only a single word, is usually a paragraph by
itself; that is, a new paragraph begins with each change of speaker. The
application of this rule when dialogue and narrative are combined is best
learned from examples in well-edited works of fiction. Sometimes a writer,
seeking to create an effect of rapid talk or for some other reason, will elect
not to set off each speech in a separate paragraph and instead will run speeches
together. The common practice, however, and the one that serves best in most
instances, is to give each speech a paragraph of its own.

As a rule, begin each paragraph either with a sentence that suggests the topic
or with a sentence that helps the transition. If a paragraph forms part of a
larger composition, its relation to what precedes, or its function as a part of
the whole, may need to be expressed. This can sometimes be done by a mere word
or phrase (again, therefore, for the same reason) in the first sentence.
Sometimes, however, it is expedient to get into the topic slowly, by way of a
sentence or two of introduction or transition.

In narration and description, the paragraph sometimes begins with a concise,
comprehensive statement serving to hold together the details that follow.

    The breeze served us admirably.

    The campaign opened with a series of reverses.

    The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious set of entries.

But when this device, or any device, is too often used, it becomes a mannerism.
More commonly, the opening sentence simply indicates by its subject the
direction the paragraph is to take.

    At length I thought I might return toward the stockade.

    He picked up the heavy lamp from the table and began to explore.

    Another flight of steps, and they emerged on the roof.

In animated narrative, the paragraphs are likely to be short and without any
semblance of a topic sentence, the writer rushing headlong, event following
event in rapid succession. The break between such paragraphs merely serves the
purpose of a rhetorical pause, throwing into prominence some detail of the
action.

In general, remember that paragraphing calls for a good eye as well as a logical
mind. Enormous blocks of print look formidable to readers, who are often
reluctant to tackle them. Therefore, breaking long paragraphs in two, even if it
is not necessary to do so for sense, meaning, or logical development, is often a
visual help. But remember, too, that firing off many short paragraphs in quick
succession can be distracting. Paragraph breaks used only for show read like the
writing of commerce or of display advertising. Moderation and a sense of order
should be the main considerations in paragraphing.

## 14. Use the active voice

The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive:

    I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.

This is much better than

    My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.

The latter sentence is less direct, less bold, and less concise. If the writer
tries to make it more concise by omitting "by me,"

    My first visit to Boston will always be remembered,

it becomes indefinite: is it the writer or some undisclosed person or the world
at large that will always remember this visit?

This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely discard the
passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary.

    The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today.

    Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the Restoration.

The first would be the preferred form in a paragraph on the dramatists of the
Restoration, the second in a paragraph on the tastes of modern readers. The need
to make a particular word the subject of the sentence will often, as in these
examples, determine which voice is to be used.

The habitual use of the active voice, however, makes for forcible writing. This
is true not only in narrative concerned principally with action but in writing
of any kind. Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made
lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some
such perfunctory expression as there is or could be heard.

    There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground.

    Dead leaves covered the ground.

    At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard.

    The cock's crow came with dawn.

    The reason he left college was that his health became impaired.

    Failing health compelled him to leave college.

    It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had.

    She soon repented her words.

Note, in the examples above, that when a sentence is made stronger, it usually
becomes shorter. Thus, brevity is a by-product of vigor.

## 15. Put statements in positive form

Make definite assertions. Avoid tame, colorless, hesitating, noncommittal
language. Use the word not as a means of denial or in antithesis, never as a
means of evasion.

    He was not very often on time.

    He usually came late.

    She did not think that studying Latin was a sensible way to use one's time.

    She thought the study of Latin a waste of time.

    The Taming of the Shrew is rather weak in spots. Shakespeare does not
    portray Katharine as a very admirable character, nor does Bianca remain
    long in memory as an important character in Shakespeare's works.

    The women in The Taming of the Shrew are unattractive. Katharine is
    disagreeable, Bianca insignificant.

The last example, before correction, is indefinite as well as negative. The
corrected version, consequently, is simply a guess at the writer's intention.

All three examples show the weakness inherent in the word not. Consciously or
unconsciously, the reader is dissatisfied with being told only what is not; the
reader wishes to be told what is. Hence, as a rule, it is better to express even
a negative in positive form.

    not honest                              dishonest
    not important                           trifling
    did not remember                        forgot
    did not pay any attention to            ignored
    did not have much confidence in         distrusted

Placing negative and positive in opposition makes for a stronger structure.

    Not charity, but simple justice.

    Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.

    Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your
    country.

Negative words other than not are usually strong.

    Her loveliness I never knew / Until she smiled on me.

Statements qualified with unnecessary auxiliaries or conditionals sound
irresolute.

    If you would let us know the time of your arrival, we would be happy to
    arrange your transportation from the airport.

    If you will let us know the time of your arrival, we shall be happy to
    arrange your transportation from the airport.

    Applicants can make a good impression by being neat and punctual.

    Applicants will make a good impression if they are neat and punctual.

    Plath may be ranked among those modem poets who died young.

    Plath was one of those modern poets who died young.

If your every sentence admits a doubt, your writing will lack authority. Save
the auxiliaries would, should, could, may, might, and can for situations
involving real uncertainty.

## 16. Use definite, specific, concrete language

Prefer the specific to the general, the definite to the vague, the concrete to
the abstract.

    A period of unfavorable weather set in.

    It rained every day for a week.

    He showed satisfaction as he took possession of his well-earned reward.

    He grinned as he pocketed the coin.

If those who have studied the art of writing are in accord on any one point, it
is this: the surest way to arouse and hold the readers attention is by being
specific, definite, and concrete. The greatest writers — Homer, Dante,
Shakespeare — are effective largely because they deal in particulars and report
the details that matter. Their words call up pictures.

Jean Stafford, to cite a more modern author, demonstrates in her short story "In
the Zoo" how prose is made vivid by the use of words that evoke images and
sensations:

```
... Daisy and I in time found asylum in a small menagerie down by the railroad
tracks. It belonged to a gentle alcoholic ne'er-do-well, who did nothing all
day long but drink bathtub gin in rickeys and play solitaire and smile to
himself and talk to his animals. He had a little, stunted red vixen and a
deodorized skunk, a parrot from Tahiti that spoke Parisian French, a woebegone
coyote, and two capuchin monkeys, so serious and humanized, so small and sad and
sweet, and so religious-looking with their tonsured heads that it was impossible
not to think their gibberish was really an ordered language with a grammar that
someday some philologist would understand.

Gran knew about our visits to Mr. Murphy and she did not object, for it gave her
keen pleasure to excoriate him when we came home. His vice was not a matter of
guesswork; it was an established fact that he was half-seas over from dawn till
midnight. "With the black Irish," said Gran, "the taste for drink is taken in
with the mother's milk and is never mastered. Oh, I know all about those
promises to join the temperance movement and not to touch another drop. The way
to Hell is paved with good intentions."*
```

If the experiences of Walter Mitty, of Molly Bloom, of Rabbit Angstrom have
seemed for the moment real to countless readers, if in reading Faulkner we have
almost the sense of inhabiting Yoknapatawpha County during the decline of the
South, it is because the details used are definite, the terms concrete. It is
not that every detail is given — that would be impossible, as well as to no
purpose — but that all the significant details are given, and with such accuracy
and vigor that readers, in imagination, can project themselves into the scene.

In exposition and in argument, the writer must likewise never lose hold of the
concrete; and even when dealing with general principles, the writer must furnish
particular instances of their application.

In his Philosophy of Style, Herbert Spencer gives two sentences to illustrate
how the vague and general can be turned into the vivid and particular:

    In proportion as the manners, customs, and amusements of a nation are cruel
    and barbarous, the regulations of its penal code will be severe.

    In proportion as men delight in battles, bullfights, and combats of
    gladiators, will they punish by hanging, burning, and the rack.

To show what happens when strong writing is deprived of its vigor, George Orwell
once took a passage from the Bible and drained it of its blood. On the left,
below, is Orwell's translation; on the right, the verse from Ecclesiastes (King
James Version).

    Objective consideration of contemporary phenomena compels the conclusion
    that success or failure in competitive activities exhibits no tendency to
    be commensurate with innate capacity, but that a considerable element of
    the unpredictable must inevitably be taken into account.

    I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor
    the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to
    men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance
    happeneth to them all.

## 17. Omit needless words

Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a
paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should
have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not
that the writer make all sentences short, or avoid all detail and treat subjects
only in outline, but that every word tell.

Many expressions in common use violate this principle.

    the question as to whether            whether (the question whether)
    there is no doubt but that            no doubt (doubtless)
    used for fuel purposes                used for fuel
    he is a man who                       he
    in a hasty manner                     hastily
    this is a subject that                this subject
    Her story is a strange one.           Her story is strange.
    the reason why is that                because

The fact that is an especially debilitating expression. It should be revised out
of every sentence in which it occurs.

    owing to the fact that                     since (because)
    in spite of the fact that                  though (although)
    call your attention to the fact that       remind you (notify you)
    I was unaware of the fact that             I was unaware that (did not know)
    the fact that he had not succeeded         his failure
    the fact that I had arrived                my arrival

See also the words case, character, nature in Chapter IV. Who is, which was, and
the like are often superfluous.

    His cousin, who is a member of the same firm

    His cousin, a member of the same firm

    Trafalgar, which was Nelson's last battle

    Trafalgar, Nelson's last battle

As the active voice is more concise than the passive, and a positive statement
more concise than a negative one, many of the examples given under Rules 14 and
15 illustrate this rule as well.

A common way to fall into wordiness is to present a single complex idea, step by
step, in a series of sentences that might to advantage be combined into one.

```
Macbeth was very ambitious. This led him to wish to become king of Scotland. The
witches told him that this wish of his would come true. The king of Scotland at
this time was Duncan. Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth murdered Duncan. He was
thus enabled to succeed Duncan as king. (51 words)
```

```
Encouraged by his wife, Macbeth achieved his ambition and realized the
prediction of the witches by murdering Duncan and becoming king of Scotland in
his place. (26 words)
