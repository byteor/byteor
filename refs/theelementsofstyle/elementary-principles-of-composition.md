# Elementary Principles of Composition

## 12. Choose a suitable design and hold to it

A basic structural design underlies every kind of writing. Writers will in part
follow this design, in part deviate from it, according to their skills, their
needs, and the unexpected events that accompany the act of composition. Writing,
to be effective, must follow closely the thoughts of the writer, but not
necessarily in the order in which those thoughts occur.

This calls for a scheme of procedure. In some cases, the best design is no
design, as with a love letter, which is simply an outpouring, or with a casual
essay, which is a ramble. But in most cases, planning must be a deliberate
prelude to writing. The first principle of composition, therefore, is to foresee
or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.

A sonnet is built on a fourteen-line frame, each line containing five feet.
Hence, sonneteers know exactly where they are headed, although they may not know
how to get there. Most forms of composition are less clearly defined, more
flexible, but all have skeletons to which the writer bring the flesh and the
blood. The more clearly the writer perceives the shape, the better are the
chances of success.

## 13. Make the paragraph the unit of composition

The paragraph is a convenient unit; it serves all forms of literary work. As
long as it holds together, a paragraph may be of any length — a single, short
sentence or a passage of great duration.

If the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent, or if you intend to
treat it briefly, there may be no need to divide it into topics. Thus, a brief
description, a brief book review, a brief account of a single incident, a
narrative merely outlining an action, the setting forth of a single idea — any
one of these is best written in a single paragraph. After the paragraph has been
written, examine it to see whether division will improve it.

Ordinarily, however, a subject requires division into topics, each of which
should be dealt with in a paragraph. The object of treating each topic in a
paragraph by itself is, of course, to aid the reader. The beginning of each
paragraph is a signal that a new step in the development of the subject has been
reached.

As a rule, single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs. An
exception may be made of sentences of transition, indicating the relation
between the parts of an exposition or argument

In dialogue, each speech, even if only a single word, is usually a paragraph by
itself; that is, a new paragraph begins with each change of speaker. The
application of this rule when dialogue and narrative are combined is best
learned from examples in well-edited works of fiction. Sometimes a writer,
seeking to create an effect of rapid talk or for some other reason, will elect
not to set off each speech in a separate paragraph and instead will run speeches
together. The common practice, however, and the one that serves best in most
instances, is to give each speech a paragraph of its own.

As a rule, begin each paragraph either with a sentence that suggests the topic
or with a sentence that helps the transition. If a paragraph forms part of a
larger composition, its relation to what precedes, or its function as a part of
the whole, may need to be expressed. This can sometimes be done by a mere word
or phrase (again, therefore, for the same reason) in the first sentence.
Sometimes, however, it is expedient to get into the topic slowly, by way of a
sentence or two of introduction or transition.

In narration and description, the paragraph sometimes begins with a concise,
comprehensive statement serving to hold together the details that follow.

    The breeze served us admirably.

    The campaign opened with a series of reverses.

    The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious set of entries.

But when this device, or any device, is too often used, it becomes a mannerism.
More commonly, the opening sentence simply indicates by its subject the
direction the paragraph is to take.

    At length I thought I might return toward the stockade.

    He picked up the heavy lamp from the table and began to explore.

    Another flight of steps, and they emerged on the roof.

In animated narrative, the paragraphs are likely to be short and without any
semblance of a topic sentence, the writer rushing headlong, event following
event in rapid succession. The break between such paragraphs merely serves the
purpose of a rhetorical pause, throwing into prominence some detail of the
action.

In general, remember that paragraphing calls for a good eye as well as a logical
mind. Enormous blocks of print look formidable to readers, who are often
reluctant to tackle them. Therefore, breaking long paragraphs in two, even if it
is not necessary to do so for sense, meaning, or logical development, is often a
visual help. But remember, too, that firing off many short paragraphs in quick
succession can be distracting. Paragraph breaks used only for show read like the
writing of commerce or of display advertising. Moderation and a sense of order
should be the main considerations in paragraphing.
