# Elementary Principles of Composition

## 12. Choose a suitable design and hold to it

A basic structural design underlies every kind of writing. Writers will in part
follow this design, in part deviate from it, according to their skills, their
needs, and the unexpected events that accompany the act of composition. Writing,
to be effective, must follow closely the thoughts of the writer, but not
necessarily in the order in which those thoughts occur.

This calls for a scheme of procedure. In some cases, the best design is no
design, as with a love letter, which is simply an outpouring, or with a casual
essay, which is a ramble. But in most cases, planning must be a deliberate
prelude to writing. The first principle of composition, therefore, is to foresee
or determine the shape of what is to come and pursue that shape.

A sonnet is built on a fourteen-line frame, each line containing five feet.
Hence, sonneteers know exactly where they are headed, although they may not know
how to get there. Most forms of composition are less clearly defined, more
flexible, but all have skeletons to which the writer bring the flesh and the
blood. The more clearly the writer perceives the shape, the better are the
chances of success.

## 13. Make the paragraph the unit of composition

The paragraph is a convenient unit; it serves all forms of literary work. As
long as it holds together, a paragraph may be of any length — a single, short
sentence or a passage of great duration.

If the subject on which you are writing is of slight extent, or if you intend to
treat it briefly, there may be no need to divide it into topics. Thus, a brief
description, a brief book review, a brief account of a single incident, a
narrative merely outlining an action, the setting forth of a single idea — any
one of these is best written in a single paragraph. After the paragraph has been
written, examine it to see whether division will improve it.

Ordinarily, however, a subject requires division into topics, each of which
should be dealt with in a paragraph. The object of treating each topic in a
paragraph by itself is, of course, to aid the reader. The beginning of each
paragraph is a signal that a new step in the development of the subject has been
reached.

As a rule, single sentences should not be written or printed as paragraphs. An
exception may be made of sentences of transition, indicating the relation
between the parts of an exposition or argument

In dialogue, each speech, even if only a single word, is usually a paragraph by
itself; that is, a new paragraph begins with each change of speaker. The
application of this rule when dialogue and narrative are combined is best
learned from examples in well-edited works of fiction. Sometimes a writer,
seeking to create an effect of rapid talk or for some other reason, will elect
not to set off each speech in a separate paragraph and instead will run speeches
together. The common practice, however, and the one that serves best in most
instances, is to give each speech a paragraph of its own.

As a rule, begin each paragraph either with a sentence that suggests the topic
or with a sentence that helps the transition. If a paragraph forms part of a
larger composition, its relation to what precedes, or its function as a part of
the whole, may need to be expressed. This can sometimes be done by a mere word
or phrase (again, therefore, for the same reason) in the first sentence.
Sometimes, however, it is expedient to get into the topic slowly, by way of a
sentence or two of introduction or transition.

In narration and description, the paragraph sometimes begins with a concise,
comprehensive statement serving to hold together the details that follow.

    The breeze served us admirably.

    The campaign opened with a series of reverses.

    The next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious set of entries.

But when this device, or any device, is too often used, it becomes a mannerism.
More commonly, the opening sentence simply indicates by its subject the
direction the paragraph is to take.

    At length I thought I might return toward the stockade.

    He picked up the heavy lamp from the table and began to explore.

    Another flight of steps, and they emerged on the roof.

In animated narrative, the paragraphs are likely to be short and without any
semblance of a topic sentence, the writer rushing headlong, event following
event in rapid succession. The break between such paragraphs merely serves the
purpose of a rhetorical pause, throwing into prominence some detail of the
action.

In general, remember that paragraphing calls for a good eye as well as a logical
mind. Enormous blocks of print look formidable to readers, who are often
reluctant to tackle them. Therefore, breaking long paragraphs in two, even if it
is not necessary to do so for sense, meaning, or logical development, is often a
visual help. But remember, too, that firing off many short paragraphs in quick
succession can be distracting. Paragraph breaks used only for show read like the
writing of commerce or of display advertising. Moderation and a sense of order
should be the main considerations in paragraphing.

## 14. Use the active voice

The active voice is usually more direct and vigorous than the passive:

    I shall always remember my first visit to Boston.

This is much better than

    My first visit to Boston will always be remembered by me.

The latter sentence is less direct, less bold, and less concise. If the writer
tries to make it more concise by omitting "by me,"

    My first visit to Boston will always be remembered,

it becomes indefinite: is it the writer or some undisclosed person or the world
at large that will always remember this visit?

This rule does not, of course, mean that the writer should entirely discard the
passive voice, which is frequently convenient and sometimes necessary.

    The dramatists of the Restoration are little esteemed today.

    Modern readers have little esteem for the dramatists of the Restoration.

The first would be the preferred form in a paragraph on the dramatists of the
Restoration, the second in a paragraph on the tastes of modern readers. The need
to make a particular word the subject of the sentence will often, as in these
examples, determine which voice is to be used.

The habitual use of the active voice, however, makes for forcible writing. This
is true not only in narrative concerned principally with action but in writing
of any kind. Many a tame sentence of description or exposition can be made
lively and emphatic by substituting a transitive in the active voice for some
such perfunctory expression as there is or could be heard.

    There were a great number of dead leaves lying on the ground.

    Dead leaves covered the ground.

    At dawn the crowing of a rooster could be heard.

    The cock's crow came with dawn.

    The reason he left college was that his health became impaired.

    Failing health compelled him to leave college.

    It was not long before she was very sorry that she had said what she had.

    She soon repented her words.

Note, in the examples above, that when a sentence is made stronger, it usually
becomes shorter. Thus, brevity is a by-product of vigor.
