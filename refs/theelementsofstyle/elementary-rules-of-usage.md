# Elementary Rules of Usage

## Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.

Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write,

    Charles's friend
    Burn's poems
    the witch's malice

Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names ending in -es and -is,
the possessive Jesus', and such forms as for conscience' sake, for
righteousness' sake. But such forms as Moses' Laws, Isis' temple are commonly
replaced by

    the laws of Moses
    the temple of Isis

The pronominal possessives hers, its, theirs, yours, and ours have no
apostrophe. Indefinite pronouns, however, use the apostrophe to show possession.

    one's rights
    somebody else's umbrella

A common error is to write it's for its, or vice versa. The first is a
contraction, meaning "It is." The second is a possessive.

    It's a wise dog that scratches its own fleas.

## In a series of three or more terms with a single conjunction, use a comma after each term except the last

Thus write,

    red, white, and blue gold, silver, or copper

    He opened the letter, read it, and made a note of its contents.

This comma is often referred to as the "serial" comma. In the names of business
firms the last comma is usually omitted. Follow the usage of the individual firm.

    Little, Brown and Company Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette

## Enclose parenthetic expressions between commas

    The best way to see a country, unless you are pressed for time, is to travel
    on foot.

This rule is difficult to apply; it is frequently hard to decide whether a
single word, such as however, or a brief phrase is or is not parenthetic. If the
interruption to the flow of the sentence is but slight, the commas may be safely
omitted. But whether the interruption is slight or considerable, never omit one
comma and leave the other. There is no defense for such punctuation as:

    Marjories husband, Colonel Nelson paid us a visit yesterday.

    or

    My brother you will be pleased to hear, is now in perfect health.

Dates usually contain parenthetic words or figures. Punctuate as follows:

    February to July, 1992

    April 6, 1986

    Wednesday, November 14, 1990

Note that it is customary to omit the comma in

    6 April 1998

The last form is an excellent way to write a date; the figures are separated by
a word and are, for the reason, quickly grasped.

A name or a little in direct address is parenthetic.

    If, Sir, you refuse, I cannot predict what will happen.

    Well. Susan, this is a fine mess you are in.

The abbreviations etc., i.e., and e.g., the abbreviations for academic degrees,
and titles that follow a name are parenthetic and should be punctuated
accordingly.

    Letters, packages, etc., should go here.

    Horace Fulsome, Ph.D., presided.

    Rachel Simonds, Attorney

    The Reverend Harry Lang, S.J.

No comma, however, should separate a noun from a restrictive term of
identification.

    Billy the Kid

    The novelist Jane Austen

    William the Conqueror

    The poet Sappho

Although Junior, with is abbreviation Jr., has commonly been regarded as
parenthetic, logic suggests that it is, in fact, restrictive and terefore not in
need of a comma.

    James Wright Jr.

Nonrestrictive relative clauses are parenthetic, as are similar clauses
introduced by conjunctions indicating time or place. Commas are therefore
needed. A nonrestrictive clause is one that does not serve to identify or define
the antecedent noun.

    The audience, which had at first been iindifferent, became more and more
    interested.

    In 1769, when Napoleon was born, Corsica had but recently been acquired
    by France.

    Nether Stowey, where Coleridge wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, is a
    few miles from Bridgewater.

In these sentenses, the clauses introduced by which, when, and where are
nonrestrictive; they do not limit or define, the merely add something. In the
first example, the cluase introduced by which does not serve to tell which of
serveral possible audiences is meant; the reader presumably knows that already.
The clause adds, parenthetically, a statement supplementing that in the main
clause. Each of the three sentences is a combination of two statements that
might have been made independently.

    The audience was at first indifferent. Later it became more and more
    interested.

    Napoleon was bown in 1769. At that time Corsica had but recently been
    acquired by France.

    Coleridge wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner at Nether Stowey. Nether
    Stowey is a few miles from Bridgewater.

Restrictive clauses, by contrast, are not parenthetic and are not set off by
commas. Thus,

    People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.

Here the clause introduced by who does serve to tell which people are meant; the
sentence, unlike the sentenses above, cannot be split into two independent
statements. The same priciple of comma use applies to participial phrases and to
appositives.

    People sitting in the rear couldn't hear, (restrictive)

    Uncle Bert, being slightly deaf, moved forward, (non-restrictive)

    My cusin Bob is a talented harpist, (restrictive)

    Our oldest daughter, Mary, sings, (nonrestrictive)

When the main clause of a sentence is preceded by a phrase or a subordinate
clause, use a comma to set off these elements.

    Partly by hard fighting, partly by diplomatic skill, they enlarged their
    dominions to the east and rose to royal rank with the possession of Sicily.
