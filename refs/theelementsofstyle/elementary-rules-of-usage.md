# Elementary Rules of Usage

## Form the possessive singular of nouns by adding 's.

Follow this rule whatever the final consonant. Thus write,

  Charles's friend
  Burn's poems
  the witch's malice

Exceptions are the possessives of ancient proper names ending in -es and -is,
the possessive Jesus', and such forms as for conscience' sake, for
righteousness' sake. But such forms as Moses' Laws, Isis' temple are commonly
replaced by

  the laws of Moses
  the temple of Isis

The pronominal possessives hers, its, theirs, yours, and ours have no
apostrophe. Indefinite pronouns, however, use the apostrophe to show possession.

  one's rights
  somebody else's umbrella

A common error is to write it's for its, or vice versa. The first is a
contraction, meaning "It is." The second is a possessive.

  It's a wise dog that scratches its own fleas.
