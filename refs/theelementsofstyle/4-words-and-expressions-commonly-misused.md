# Words and Expressions Commonly Misused

Many of the words and expressions listed here are not so much bad English as bad
style, the commonplaces of careless writing. As illustrated under Feature, the
proper correction is likely to be not the replacement of one word or set of
words by another but the replace of vague generality by definite statement.

The shape of our language is not rigid; in questions of usage we have no
lawgiver whose word is final. Students whose curiosity is aroused by the
interpretations that follow, or whose doubts are raised, will wish to pursue
their investigations further. Books useful in such pursuits are Merriam
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition; The American Heritage Dictionary
of the English Language, Third Edition; Webster's Third New International
Dictionary; The New Fowler's Modern English Usage, Third Edition, edited by R.
W. Burchfield; Modern American Usage: A Guide by Wilson Follett and Erik
Wensberg; and The Careful Writer by Theodore M. Bernstein.

## *Aggravate*. *Irritate*.
The first means "to add to" an already troublesome or vexing matter or
condition. The second means "to vex" or "to annoy" or "to chafe."

## *All right*.
Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense "Agreed," or "Go
ahead," or "O.K." Properly written as two words -- all right.

## *Allude*.
Do not confuse with elude. You allude to a book; you elude a pursuer. Note, too,
that allude is not synonymous with refer. An allusion is an indirect mention, a
reference is a specific one.

## *Allusion*.
Easily confused with illusion. The first means "an indirect reference"; the
second means "an unreal image" or "a false impression."

## *Alternate. Alternative*.
The words are not always interchangeable as nouns or adjectives. The first means
every other one in a series; the second, one of two possibilities. As the other
one of a series of two, an alternate may stand for "a substitute," but an
alternative, although used in a similar sense, connotes a matter of choice that
is never present with alternate.

As the flooded road left them no alternative, they took the alternate one.

## *Among. Between.*
When more than two things or persons are involved, among is usually called for:
"The money was divided among the four players." When, however, more than two are
involved but each is considered individually, between is preferred: "an
agreement between the six heirs."

## *And/or.*
A device, or shortcut, that damages a sentence and often leads to confusion or
ambiguity.

    First of all, would an honor system successfully cut down on the amount of stealing and/or cheanting?

    First of all, would an honor system reduce the incidence of stealing or cheanting or both?

## *Anticipate.*
Use expect in the sense of simple expectation.

    I anticipated that he would look older.

    I expected that he would book older.

    My brother anticipated the upturn in the market.

    My brother expected the upturn in the market.

In the second example, the word anticipated is ambiguous. It could mean simply
that the brother believed the upturn would occur, or it would mean that he acted
in advance of the expected upturn -- by buying stock, perhaps.

## *Anybody.*
In the sense of "any person," not to be written as two words. Any body means
"any corpse," or "any human form," or "any group." The rule holds equally for
everybody, nobody, and somebody.

## *Anyone.*
In the sense of "anybody," written as one word. Any one means "any single
person" or "any single thing."

## *As good or better than.*
Expressions of this type should be corrected by rearranging the sentences.

    My opinion is as good or better than this.

    My opinion is as good as his, or better (if not better).

## *As to whether.*
Whether is sufficient.

## *As yet.*
Yet nearly always is as good, if not better.

    No agreement has been reached as yet.

    No agreement has yet been reached.

    Yet (or despite everything) he has not succeeded.

    As yet (or so far) he has not succeeded.

## *Being.*
Not appropriate after regard ... as.

    He is regarded as being the best dancer in the club.

    He is regarded as the best dancer in the club.

## *But.*
Unnecessary after doubt and help.

    I have no doubt but that

    I have no doubt that

    He could not help but see that

    He could not help seeing that

The too-frequent use of that as a conjunction leads to the fault discussed under
Rule 18. A loose sentence formed with but can usually be converted into a
periodic sentence formed with although.

Particularly awkward is one but closely following another, thus making a
contrast to a contrast, or a reservation to a reservation. this is easily
corrected by rearrangement.

    Our country had vast resources but seemed almost wholly unprepared for war. But within a year it had created an army of four million.

    Our country seemed almost wholly unprepared for war, but it had vast resources. Within a year it had created an army of four million.

## *Can.*
Means "am (is, are) able." Not to be used as a substitute for may.

## *Care less.*
The dismissive "I couldn't care less" is often used with the shortened "not"
mistakenly (and mysteriously) omitted: "I could care less." The error destroys
the meaning of the sentence and is careless indeed.

## *Case.*
Often unnecessary.

    In many cases, the rooms lacked air conditioning.

    Many of the rooms lacked air conditioning.

    It has rarely been the case that any mistake has been made.

    Few mistakes have been made.

## *Certainly.*
Used indiscriminately by some speakers, much as others use very, in an attempt
to intensify any and every statement. A mannerism of this kind, bad in speech,
is even worse in writing.

## *Character.*
Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of wordiness.

    acts of a hostile character

    hostile acts

## *Claim (verb).*
With object-noun, means "lay claim to." May be used with a dependent clause if
this sense is clearly intended: "She claimed that she was the sole heir." (But
even here claimed to be would be better.) Not to be used as a substitute for
declare, maintain, or charge.

    He claimed he knew how.

    He declared he knew how.

## *Clever.*
Note that the word means one thing when applied to people, another when applied
to horses. A clever horse is a good-natured one, not an ingenious one.

## *Compare.*
To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as
essentially of a different order; to compare with is mainly to point out
differences between objects regarded as essentially of the same order. Thus,
life has been compared to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be
compared with the British Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens;
it may be compared with modern London.

## *Comprise.*
Literally, "embrace": A zoo comprise mammals, reptiles, and birds (because it
"embraces", or "includes," them). But animals do not comprise ("embrace") a zoo
-- they constitute a zoo.

## *Consider.*
Not followed by as when it means "believe to be."

    I consider him as competent.

    I consider him competent.

When considered means "examined" or "discussed," it is followed by as:

    The lecturer  considered Eisenhower first as soldier and second as administrator.

## *Contact.*
As a transitive verb, the word is vague and self-important. Do not contact
people; get in touch with them, look them up, phone them, find them, or meet
them.

## *Cope.*
An intransitive verb used with with. In formal writing, one doesn't "cope," one
"copes with" something or somebody.

    I knew they'd cope. (jocular)

    I knew they would cope with the situation.

## *Currently.*
In the sense of now with a verb in the represent tense, currently is usually
redundant; emphasis is better achieved through a more precise reference to time.

    We are currently reviewing your application.

    We are at this moment reviewing your application.

## *Data.*
Like strata, phenomena, and media, data is a plural and is best used with a
plural verb. The word, however, is slowly gaining acceptance as a singular.

    The data is misleading.

    These data are misleading.

## *Different than.*
Here logic supports established usage: one thing differs from another, hence,
different from, Or, other than, unlike.

## *Disinterested.*
Means "impartial." Do not confuse it with uninterested, which means "not
interested in."

    Let a disinterested person judge our dispute. (an impartial person)

    This mean is obviously uninterested in our dispute. (couldn't care less)

## *Divided into.*
Not to be misused for composed of. The line is sometimes difficult to draw;
doubtless plays are divided into acts, but poems are composed of stanzas. An
apple, halved, is divided into sections, but an apple is composed of seeds,
flesh, and skin.

## *Due to.*
Loosely used for through, because of, or owing to, in adverbial phrases.

    He lost the first game due to carelessness.

    He lost the first game because of carelessness.

In correct use, synonymous with attributable to: "The accident was due to bad
weather"; "losses due to preventable fires."

## *Each and every one.*
Pitchman's jargon. Avoid, except in dialogue.

    It should be a lesson to each and every one of us.

    It should be a lesson to every one of us (to us all).

## *Effect.*
As a noun, means "result"; as a verb, means "to bring about," "to accomplish"
(not to be confused with effect, which means "to influence").

As a noun, often loosely used in perfunctory writing about fashions, music,
painting, and other arts: "a Southwestern effect"; "effects in pale green";
"very delicate effects"; "subtle effects"; "a charming effect was produced." The
writer who has a definite meaning to express will not take refuge in such
vagueness.

## *Enormity.*
Use only in the sense of "monstrous wickedness." Misleading, if not wrong, when
used to express bigness.

## *Enthuse.*
An annoying web growing out of the noun enthusiasm. Not recommended.

    She was enthused about her new car.

    She was enthusiastic about her new car.

    She enthused about her new car.

    She talked enthusiastically (expressed enthusiasm) about her new car.

## *Etc.*
Literally, "and other things."; sometimes loosely used to mean "and other
persons." The phrase is equivalent to and the rest, and so forth, and hence is
not to be used if one of these would be insufficient -- that is, if the reader
would be left in doubt as to any important particulars. Least open to objection
when it represents the last terms of a list already given almost in full, or
immaterial words at the end of a quotation.

At the end of a list introduced by such as, for example, or any similar
expression, etc. is incorrect. In formal writing, etc. is a misfit. An item
important enough to call for etc. is probably important enough to be named.

## *Fact.*
Use this word only of matters capable of direct verification, not of matters of
judgment. That a particular event happened on a given date and that lead melts
at a certain temperature are facts. But such conclusions as that climate of
California is delightful, however defensible they may be, are not properly
called facts.

## *Facility.*
Why must jails, hospitals, and schools suddenly become "facilities"?

    Parents complained bitterly about the fire hazard in the wooden facility.

    Parents complained bitterly about the fire hazard in the wooden schoolhouse.

    He has been appointed warden of the new facility.

    He has been appointed warden of the new prison.

## *Factor.*
A hackneyed word; the expressions of which it is a part can usually be replaced
by something more direct and idiomatic.

    Her superior training was the great factor in her winning the match.

    She won the match by being better tarined.

    Air power is becoming an increasingly important factor in deciding battles.

    Air power is playing a larger and larger part in deciding battles.

## *Farther, Further.*
The two words are commonly interchanged, but there is a distinction worth
observing: farther serves best as a distance word, further as a time or quantity
word. You chase a ball farther than the other fellow; you pursue a subject
further.

## *Feature.*
Another hackneyed word; like factor; it usually adds nothing to the sentence in
which it occurs.

    A feature of the entertainment especially worthy of mention was the singing of Allison Jones.

    (Better use the same number of words to tell what Allison Jones sang and how she sang it.)

As a verb, in the sense of "offer as a special attraction," it is to be avoided.

## *Finalize.*
A pompous, ambiguous verb. (See Chapter V, Reminder 21.)

## *Fix.*
Colloquial in America for arrange, prepare, mend. The usage is well established,
But bear in mind that this verb is from figere: "to make firm," "to place
definitely." These are the preferred meanings of the word.

## *Flammable.*
An oddity, chiefly useful in saving lives. The common word meaning "combustible"
is inflammable. But some people are thrown off by the in- and think inflammable
means "not combustible." For this reason, trucks carrying gasoline or explosives
are now marked FLAMMABLE. Unless you are operating a truck and hence are
concerned with the safety of children and illiterates, use inflammable.

## *Folk.*
A collective noun, equivalent to people. Use the singular only. Folks, in the
sense of "parents," "family," "those present," is colloquial and too folksy for
formal writing.

    Her folks arrived by the afternoon train.

    Her father and mother arrived by the afternoon train.

## *Fortuitous.*
Limited to what happens by chance. Not to be used for fortunate or lucky.

## *Get.*
The colloquial have got for have should not be used in writing. The preferable
form of the participle is got.

    He has not got any sense.
    He has no sense.
    They returned without having gotten any.
    They returned without having got any.

## *Gratuitous.*
Means "unearned," or "unwarranted."

    This insult seemed gratuitous. (undeserved)

## *He is a man who.*
A common type of redundant expression; see Rule 17.

    He is a man who is very ambitious.
    He is very ambitious.
    Vermont is a state that attracts visitors because of its winter sports.
    Vermont attracts visitors because of its winter sports.

## *Hopefully.*
This once-useful adverb meaning "with hope" has been distorted and is now widely
used to mean "I hope" or "it is to be hoped." Such use is not merely wrong, it
is silly. To say, "Hopefully I'll leave on the noon plane" is to talk nonsense.
Do you mean you'll leave on the noon plane in a hopeful frame of mind? Or do you
mean you hope you'll leave on the noon plane? Whichever you mean, you haven't
said it clearly. Although the word in its new, free-floating capacity may be
pleasurable and even useful to many, it offends the ear of many others, who do
not like to see words dulled or eroded, particularly when the erosion leads to
ambiguity, softness, or nonsense.

## *However.*
Avoid starting a sentence with however when the meaning is "nevertheless." The
word usually serves better when not in first position.

    The roads were almost impassable. However, we at last succeeded in reaching camp.
    The roads were almost impassable. At last, however, we succeeded in reaching camp.

When however comes first, it means "in whatever way" or "to whatever extent."

    However you advise him, he will probably do as he thinks best.
    However discouraging the prospect, they never lost hert.

## *Illusion.*
See allusion.

## *Imply. Infer.*
Not interchangeable. Something implied is something suggested or indicated,
though not expressed. Something inferred is something deduced from evidence at
hand.

    Framing implies early rising.
    Since she was a farmer, we inferred that she got up early.

## *Importantly.*
Avoid by rephrasing.

    More importantly, he paid for the damages.
    What's more, he paid for the damages.
    With the breeze freshening, he altered course to pass inside the island. More importantly, as things turned out, he tucked in a reef.
    With the breeze freshening, he altered course to pass inside the island. More important, as things turned out, he tucked in a reef.

## *In regard to.*
Often wrongly written in regards to. But as regards is correct, and means the
same thing.

## *In the last analysis.*
A bankrupt expression.

## *Inside of. Inside.*
The of following inside is correct in the adverbial meaning "in less than." In
other meanings, of is unnecessary.

    Inside of five minutes I'll be inside the bank.

## *Insightful.*
The word is a suspicious overstatement for "perceptive." If it is to be used at
all, it should be used for instances of remarkably penetrating vision. Usually,
it crops up merely to inflate the commonplace.

    That was an insightful remark you made.
    That was a perceptive remark you made.

## *In terms of.*
A piece of padding usually best omitted.

    The job was unattractive in terms of salary.
    The salary made the job unattractive.

## *Interesting.*
An unconvincing word; avoid it as a means of introduction. Instead of announcing
that what you are about to tell is interesting, make it so.

    An interesting story is told of
    (Tell the story without preamble.)
    In connection with the forthcoming visit of Mr. B. to America, it is interesting to recall that he
    Mr. B., who will soon visit America

Also to be avoided in introduction is the word of funny. Nothing becomes funny
by being labeled so.

## *Irregardless.*
Should be regardless. The error results from failure to see the negative in
-less and from a desire to get it in as a prefix, suggested by such words as
irregular, irresponsible, and, perhaps especially, irrespective.

  *-ize.* Do not coin verbs by adding this tempting suffix. Many good and useful
  verbs do end in -ize: summarize, fraternize, harmonize, fertilize. But there
  is a growing list of abominations: containerize, prioritize, finalize, to name
  three. Be suspicious of -ize; let your ear and your eye guide you. Never tack
  -ize onto a noun to create a verb. Usually you will discover that a useful
  verb already exists. Why say "utilize" when there is the simple, unpretentious
  word use?

## *Kind of.*
Except in familiar style, not to be used as a substitute for rather or something
like. Restrict it to its literal sense: "Amber is a kind of fossil resin"; "I
dislike that kind of publicity." The same holds true for sort of.

## *Lay.*
A transitive verb. Except is slang("Let it lay"), do not misuse it for the
intransitive verb lie. The hen, or the play, lays an egg; the llama lies down.
The playwright went home and lay down.

    lie, lay, lain, lying
    lay, laid, laid, laying

## *Leave.*
Not to be misused for let.

    Leave it stand the way it is.
    Let it stand the way it is.
    Leave go of that rope!
    Let go of that rope!

## *Less.*
Should not be misused for fewer.

    They had less workers than in the previous campaign.
    They had fewer workers than in the previous campaign.

Less refers to quantity, fewer to number. "His troubles are less than mine"
means "His troubles are not so great as mine." "His troubles are fewer than
mine" means "His troubles are not so numerous as mine."

## *Like.*
Not to be used for the conjunction as. Like governs nouns and pronouns; before
phrases and clauses the equivalent word is as.

    We spent the evening like in the old days.
    We spent the evening as in the old days.
    Chloe smells good, like a baby should.
    Chloe smells good, as a baby should.

The use of like for as has its defenders; they argue that any usage that
achieves currency becomes valid automatically. This, they say, is the way the
language is formed. It is and it isn't. An expression sometimes merely enjoys a
vogue, much as an article of apparel does. Like has long been widely misused by
the illiterate; lately it has been taken up by the knowing and the
well-informed, who find it catchy, or liberating, and who use it as though they
were slumming. If every word or device that achieved currency were immediately
authenticated, simply on the ground of popularity, the language would be as
chaotic as a ball game with no foul lines. For the student, perhaps the most
useful thing to know about like is that most carefully edited publications
regard its use before phrases and clauses as simple error.

## *Line. Along these lines.*
Line in the sense of "course of procedure, conduct, thought" is allowable but
has been so overworked, particularly in the phrase along these lines, that a
writer who aims at freshness or originality had better discard it entirely.

    Mr. B. also spoke along the same lines.
    Mr. B. also spoke to the same effect.
    She is studying along the line of French literature.
    She is studying Frensh literature.

## *Literal. Literally.*
Often incorrectly used in support of exaggeration or violent metaphor.

    a literal flood of abuse literally dead with fatigue
    a flood of abuse almost dead with fatigue

## *A noun. As a verb, prefer lend.*

    Lend me your ears.
    the loan of your ears

## *Meaningful.*
A bankrupt adjective. Choose another, or rephrase.

    His was a meaningful contribution.
    His contribution counted heavily.
    We are instituting many meaningful changes in the curriculum.
    We are improving the curriculum in many ways.

## *Memento.*
Often incorrectly written memento.

## *Most.*
Not to be used for almost in formal composition.

    most everybody
    almost everybody
    most all the time
    almost all the time

## *Nature.*
Often simply redundant, used like character.

    acts of a hostile nature
    hostile acts

Nature should be avoided in such vague expressions as "a lover of nature,"
"poems about nature." Unless more specific statements follow, the reader cannot
tell whether the poems have to do with natural scenery, rural life, the sunset,
the untracked wilderness, or the habits of squirrels.

## *Nauseous. Nauseated.*
The first means "sickening to contemplate"; the second means "sick at the
stomach." Do not, therefore, say, "I feel nauseous," unless you are sure you
have that effect on others.

## *Nice.*
A shaggy, all-purpose word, to be used sparingly in formal composition. "I had a
nice time." "It was nice weather." "She was so nice to her mother." The meanings
are indistinct. Nice is most useful in the sense of "precise" of "delicate": "a
nice distinction."

## *Nor.*
Often used wrongly for or after negative expressions.

    He cannot eat nor sleep.
    He cannot ear or sleep.
    He can neither ear nor sleep.
    He cannot ear nor can he sleep.

## *Noun used as verb.*
Many nouns have lately been pressed into service as verbs. Not all are bad, but
all are suspect.

    Be prepared for kisses when you gift your girlfriend with this merry scent.
    Be prepared for kisses when you give your girlfriend this merry scent.

    The candidate hosted a dinner for fifty of her workers.
    The candidate gave a dinner for fifty of her workers.

    The meeting was chaired by Mr. Oglethorp.
    Mr. Oglethorp was chair of the meeting.

    She headquarters in Newark.
    She has headquarters in Newark.

    The theater troupe debuted last fall.
    The theatre troupe made its debut last fall.

## *Offputting. Ongoing.*
Newfound adjectives, to be avoided because they are inexact and clumsy. Ongoing
is a mix of "continuing" and "active" and is usually superfluous.

    He devoted all his spare time to the ongoing program for aid to the elderly.
    He devoted all his sapre time to the program for aid to the elderly.

Offputting might mean "objectionable," "disconcerting," "distasteful." Select
instead a word whose meaning is clear. As a simple test, transform the
participles to verbs. It is possible to upset something. But to offput? To ongo?

## *One.*
In the sense of "a person," not to be followed by his or her.

    One must watch his step.
    One must watch one's step. (You must watch your step.)

## *One of the most.*
Avoid this feeble formula. "One of the most exciting developments of modern
science is..."; "Switzerland is one of the most beautiful countries of Europe."
There is nothing wrong with the grammar; the formula is simply threadbare.

## *-oriented.*
A clumsy, pretentious device, much in vogue. Find a better way of indicating
orientation or alignment or direction.

    It was a manufacturing-oriented company.
    It was a company chiefly concerned with manufacturing.

    Many of the skits are situation-oriented.
    Many of the skits rely on situation.

## *Partially.*
Not always interchangeable with partly. Best used in the sense of "to a certain
degree," when speaking of a condition or state: "I'm partially resigned to it."
Partly carries the idea of a part as distinct from the whole -- usually a
physical object.

    The log was partially submerged.
    The log was partly sub-merged.

    She was partially in and partially out.
    She was parly in and partly out.
    She was part in, part out.

## *Participle for verbal noun.*

    There was little prospect of the Senate accepting.
    There was little prospect of the Senate's accepting even this compromise.

In the lefthand column, accepting is a present participle; in the righthand
column, it is a verbal noun (gerund). The construction shown in the lefthand
column is occasionally found, and has its defenders. Yet is is easy to see that
the second sentence has to do not with a prospect of the Senate but with a
prospect of accepting.

Any sentence in which the use of the possessive is awkward or impossible should
of course be recast.

    In the event of a reconsideration of the whole mater's becomming necessary.
    If it should become necessary to reconsider the whole matter.

    There was great dissatisfaction with the decision of the arbitrators being favorable to the company.
    There was great dissatisfaction with the arbitrators' decision in favor of the compay.

## *People.*
A word with many meanings. (The American Heritage Dictionary, Third Edition,
gives nine.) The people is a political support or opposition; from the public
comes artistic appreciation or commercial patronage.

The word people is best not used with words of number, in place of persons. If
of "six people" five went away, how many people would be left? Answer: one
people.

## *Personalize.*
A pretentious word, often carrying bad advice. Do not personalize your prose;
simply make it good and keep it clean. See Chaper V, Reminder 1.

    a highly personalized affair
    a highly personal affair

    Personalize your stationery.
    Design a letterhead.

## *Personally.*
Often unnecessary.

    Personally, I thought it was a good book.
    I thought it a good book.

## *Possess.*
Often used because to the writer it sounds more impressive than have or own.
Such usage is not incorrect but is to guarded against.

    She possessed great courage.
    She had great courage (was very brave).

    He was the fortunate possessor of.
    He was lucky enough to own.
