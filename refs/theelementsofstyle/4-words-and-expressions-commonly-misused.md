# Words and Expressions Commonly Misused

Many of the words and expressions listed here are not so much bad English as bad
style, the commonplaces of careless writing. As illustrated under Feature, the
proper correction is likely to be not the replacement of one word or set of
words by another but the replace of vague generality by definite statement.

The shape of our language is not rigid; in questions of usage we have no
lawgiver whose word is final. Students whose curiosity is aroused by the
interpretations that follow, or whose doubts are raised, will wish to pursue
their investigations further. Books useful in such pursuits are Merriam
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition; The American Heritage Dictionary
of the English Language, Third Edition; Webster's Third New International
Dictionary; The New Fowler's Modern English Usage, Third Edition, edited by R.
W. Burchfield; Modern American Usage: A Guide by Wilson Follett and Erik
Wensberg; and The Careful Writer by Theodore M. Bernstein.
