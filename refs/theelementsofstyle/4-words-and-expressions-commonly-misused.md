# Words and Expressions Commonly Misused

Many of the words and expressions listed here are not so much bad English as bad
style, the commonplaces of careless writing. As illustrated under Feature, the
proper correction is likely to be not the replacement of one word or set of
words by another but the replace of vague generality by definite statement.

The shape of our language is not rigid; in questions of usage we have no
lawgiver whose word is final. Students whose curiosity is aroused by the
interpretations that follow, or whose doubts are raised, will wish to pursue
their investigations further. Books useful in such pursuits are Merriam
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, Tenth Edition; The American Heritage Dictionary
of the English Language, Third Edition; Webster's Third New International
Dictionary; The New Fowler's Modern English Usage, Third Edition, edited by R.
W. Burchfield; Modern American Usage: A Guide by Wilson Follett and Erik
Wensberg; and The Careful Writer by Theodore M. Bernstein.

## *Aggravate*. *Irritate*.
The first means "to add to" an already troublesome or vexing matter or
condition. The second means "to vex" or "to annoy" or "to chafe."

## *All right*.
Idiomatic in familiar speech as a detached phrase in the sense "Agreed," or "Go
ahead," or "O.K." Properly written as two words -- all right.

## *Allude*.
Do not confuse with elude. You allude to a book; you elude a pursuer. Note, too,
that allude is not synonymous with refer. An allusion is an indirect mention, a
reference is a specific one.

## *Allusion*.
Easily confused with illusion. The first means "an indirect reference"; the
second means "an unreal image" or "a false impression."

## *Alternate. Alternative*.
The words are not always interchangeable as nouns or adjectives. The first means
every other one in a series; the second, one of two possibilities. As the other
one of a series of two, an alternate may stand for "a substitute," but an
alternative, although used in a similar sense, connotes a matter of choice that
is never present with alternate.

As the flooded road left them no alternative, they took the alternate one.

## *Among. Between.*
When more than two things or persons are involved, among is usually called for:
"The money was divided among the four players." When, however, more than two are
involved but each is considered individually, between is preferred: "an
agreement between the six heirs."

## *And/or.*
A device, or shortcut, that damages a sentence and often leads to confusion or
ambiguity.

    First of all, would an honor system successfully cut down on the amount of stealing and/or cheanting?

    First of all, would an honor system reduce the incidence of stealing or cheanting or both?

## *Anticipate.*
Use expect in the sense of simple expectation.

    I anticipated that he would look older.

    I expected that he would book older.

    My brother anticipated the upturn in the market.

    My brother expected the upturn in the market.

In the second example, the word anticipated is ambiguous. It could mean simply
that the brother believed the upturn would occur, or it would mean that he acted
in advance of the expected upturn -- by buying stock, perhaps.

## *Anybody.*
In the sense of "any person," not to be written as two words. Any body means
"any corpse," or "any human form," or "any group." The rule holds equally for
everybody, nobody, and somebody.

## *Anyone.*
In the sense of "anybody," written as one word. Any one means "any single
person" or "any single thing."

## *As good or better than.*
Expressions of this type should be corrected by rearranging the sentences.

    My opinion is as good or better than this.

    My opinion is as good as his, or better (if not better).

## *As to whether.*
Whether is sufficient.

## *As yet.*
Yet nearly always is as good, if not better.

    No agreement has been reached as yet.

    No agreement has yet been reached.

    Yet (or despite everything) he has not succeeded.

    As yet (or so far) he has not succeeded.

## *Being.*
Not appropriate after regard ... as.

    He is regarded as being the best dancer in the club.

    He is regarded as the best dancer in the club.

## *But.*
Unnecessary after doubt and help.

    I have no doubt but that

    I have no doubt that

    He could not help but see that

    He could not help seeing that

The too-frequent use of that as a conjunction leads to the fault discussed under
Rule 18. A loose sentence formed with but can usually be converted into a
periodic sentence formed with although.

Particularly awkward is one but closely following another, thus making a
contrast to a contrast, or a reservation to a reservation. this is easily
corrected by rearrangement.

    Our country had vast resources but seemed almost wholly unprepared for war. But within a year it had created an army of four million.

    Our country seemed almost wholly unprepared for war, but it had vast resources. Within a year it had created an army of four million.

## *Can.*
Means "am (is, are) able." Not to be used as a substitute for may.

## *Care less.*
The dismissive "I couldn't care less" is often used with the shortened "not"
mistakenly (and mysteriously) omitted: "I could care less." The error destroys
the meaning of the sentence and is careless indeed.

## *Case.*
Often unnecessary.

    In many cases, the rooms lacked air conditioning.

    Many of the rooms lacked air conditioning.

    It has rarely been the case that any mistake has been made.

    Few mistakes have been made.

## *Certainly.*
Used indiscriminately by some speakers, much as others use very, in an attempt
to intensify any and every statement. A mannerism of this kind, bad in speech,
is even worse in writing.

## *Character.*
Often simply redundant, used from a mere habit of wordiness.

    acts of a hostile character

    hostile acts

## *Claim (verb).*
With object-noun, means "lay claim to." May be used with a dependent clause if
this sense is clearly intended: "She claimed that she was the sole heir." (But
even here claimed to be would be better.) Not to be used as a substitute for
declare, maintain, or charge.

    He claimed he knew how.

    He declared he knew how.

## *Clever.*
Note that the word means one thing when applied to people, another when applied
to horses. A clever horse is a good-natured one, not an ingenious one.

## *Compare.*
To compare to is to point out or imply resemblances between objects regarded as
essentially of a different order; to compare with is mainly to point out
differences between objects regarded as essentially of the same order. Thus,
life has been compared to a pilgrimage, to a drama, to a battle; Congress may be
compared with the British Parliament. Paris has been compared to ancient Athens;
it may be compared with modern London.

## *Comprise.*
Literally, "embrace": A zoo comprise mammals, reptiles, and birds (because it
"embraces", or "includes," them). But animals do not comprise ("embrace") a zoo
-- they constitute a zoo.

## *Consider.*
Not followed by as when it means "believe to be."

    I consider him as competent.

    I consider him competent.

When considered means "examined" or "discussed," it is followed by as:

    The lecturer  considered Eisenhower first as soldier and second as administrator.

## *Contact.*
As a transitive verb, the word is vague and self-important. Do not contact
people; get in touch with them, look them up, phone them, find them, or meet
them.

## *Cope.*
An intransitive verb used with with. In formal writing, one doesn't "cope," one
"copes with" something or somebody.

    I knew they'd cope. (jocular)

    I knew they would cope with the situation.

## *Currently.*
In the sense of now with a verb in the represent tense, currently is usually
redundant; emphasis is better achieved through a more precise reference to time.

    We are currently reviewing your application.

    We are at this moment reviewing your application.

## *Data.*
Like strata, phenomena, and media, data is a plural and is best used with a
plural verb. The word, however, is slowly gaining acceptance as a singular.

    The data is misleading.

    These data are misleading.

## *Different than.*
Here logic supports established usage: one thing differs from another, hence,
different from, Or, other than, unlike.

## *Disinterested.*
Means "impartial." Do not confuse it with uninterested, which means "not
interested in."

    Let a disinterested person judge our dispute. (an impartial person)

    This mean is obviously uninterested in our dispute. (couldn't care less)

## *Divided into.*
Not to be misused for composed of. The line is sometimes difficult to draw;
doubtless plays are divided into acts, but poems are composed of stanzas. An
apple, halved, is divided into sections, but an apple is composed of seeds,
flesh, and skin.

## *Due to.*
Loosely used for through, because of, or owing to, in adverbial phrases.

    He lost the first game due to carelessness.

    He lost the first game because of carelessness.

In correct use, synonymous with attributable to: "The accident was due to bad
weather"; "losses due to preventable fires."

## *Each and every one.*
Pitchman's jargon. Avoid, except in dialogue.

    It should be a lesson to each and every one of us.

    It should be a lesson to every one of us (to us all).

## *Effect.*
As a noun, means "result"; as a verb, means "to bring about," "to accomplish"
(not to be confused with effect, which means "to influence").

As a noun, often loosely used in perfunctory writing about fashions, music,
painting, and other arts: "a Southwestern effect"; "effects in pale green";
"very delicate effects"; "subtle effects"; "a charming effect was produced." The
writer who has a definite meaning to express will not take refuge in such
vagueness.

## *Enormity.*
Use only in the sense of "monstrous wickedness." Misleading, if not wrong, when
used to express bigness.

## *Enthuse.*
An annoying web growing out of the noun enthusiasm. Not recommended.

    She was enthused about her new car.

    She was enthusiastic about her new car.

    She enthused about her new car.

    She talked enthusiastically (expressed enthusiasm) about her new car.

## *Etc.*
Literally, "and other things."; sometimes loosely used to mean "and other
persons." The phrase is equivalent to and the rest, and so forth, and hence is
not to be used if one of these would be insufficient -- that is, if the reader
would be left in doubt as to any important particulars. Least open to objection
when it represents the last terms of a list already given almost in full, or
immaterial words at the end of a quotation.

At the end of a list introduced by such as, for example, or any similar
expression, etc. is incorrect. In formal writing, etc. is a misfit. An item
important enough to call for etc. is probably important enough to be named.

## *Fact.*
Use this word only of matters capable of direct verification, not of matters of
judgment. That a particular event happened on a given date and that lead melts
at a certain temperature are facts. But such conclusions as that climate of
California is delightful, however defensible they may be, are not properly
called facts.

## *Facility.*
Why must jails, hospitals, and schools suddenly become "facilities"?

    Parents complained bitterly about the fire hazard in the wooden facility.

    Parents complained bitterly about the fire hazard in the wooden schoolhouse.

    He has been appointed warden of the new facility.

    He has been appointed warden of the new prison.

## *Factor.*
A hackneyed word; the expressions of which it is a part can usually be replaced
by something more direct and idiomatic.

    Her superior training was the great factor in her winning the match.

    She won the match by being better tarined.

    Air power is becoming an increasingly important factor in deciding battles.

    Air power is playing a larger and larger part in deciding battles.

## *Farther, Further.*
The two words are commonly interchanged, but there is a distinction worth
observing: farther serves best as a distance word, further as a time or quantity
word. You chase a ball farther than the other fellow; you pursue a subject
further.

## *Feature.*
Another hackneyed word; like factor; it usually adds nothing to the sentence in
which it occurs.

    A feature of the entertainment especially worthy of mention was the singing of Allison Jones.

    (Better use the same number of words to tell what Allison Jones sang and how she sang it.)

As a verb, in the sense of "offer as a special attraction," it is to be avoided.

## *Finalize.*
A pompous, ambiguous verb. (See Chapter V, Reminder 21.)

## *Fix.*
Colloquial in America for arrange, prepare, mend. The usage is well established,
But bear in mind that this verb is from figere: "to make firm," "to place
definitely." These are the preferred meanings of the word.

## *Flammable.*
An oddity, chiefly useful in saving lives. The common word meaning "combustible"
is inflammable. But some people are thrown off by the in- and think inflammable
means "not combustible." For this reason, trucks carrying gasoline or explosives
are now marked FLAMMABLE. Unless you are operating a truck and hence are
concerned with the safety of children and illiterates, use inflammable.

## *Folk.*
A collective noun, equivalent to people. Use the singular only. Folks, in the
sense of "parents," "family," "those present," is colloquial and too folksy for
formal writing.

    Her folks arrived by the afternoon train.

    Her father and mother arrived by the afternoon train.

## *Fortuitous.*
Limited to what happens by chance. Not to be used for fortunate or lucky.
