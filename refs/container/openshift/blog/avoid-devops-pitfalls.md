# Getting started with CI/CD: 6 pitfalls to avoid

“If done right, proper continuous delivery and integration can lead to great
customer experiences,” says Joy Scharmen, director of DevOps at Optimizely.

- Don't follow the recipe for tool salad

Choosing the right platforms and tools is indeed an important part of your CI/CD
plan, but your needs should dictate the tools, not vice versa.

“Instead of thinking about what tools you need, think first about the
capabilities you want, like ‘build pipeline for iOS,’ ‘build pipeline for
Android,’ ‘mobile app distribution for both platforms,’ or 'signing certificate
security and management,’” Berent-Spillson advises. “That way, you’re focusing
on how to move value through the system. The choice of tools will follow from
that.”

- Don't mess up on metrics and feedback

Continuous measurement is an important success factor for CI/CD, but it comes
with a downside: Picking the wrong things to measure.

- Don't give people a way to bypass the CI/CD pipeline

Don’t enable team members to bypass the pipeline other than under the most
extraordinary of circumstances. This can be particularly important if you’re
dealing with skepticism or cultural stasis in the earlier stages of your shift
to CI/CD.

- Don't treat automation as an infallible hero

That doesn’t mean “automate all the things” is literally the goal. On top of
automation and continuous testing, you must make sure to have intelligence built
within your CI/CD or DevOps pipeline to know when human intervention is
required.

- Don't shortchange your CI environment

A truly robust CI/CD pipeline is the sum of its parts; if you skimp on the
integration piece, that can have compounding effects later, especially when code
deploys to production.

- Don't silo development and testing

Just as DevOps success required the breakdown of traditional walls between
development and operations, CI/CD success depends upon bringing dev and testing
into closer alignment.
