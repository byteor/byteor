# Remote Command Execution

The kubelet handles remote execution requests from clients. Upon receiving a
request, it upgrades the response, evaluates the request headers to determine
what streams (stdin, stdout, and/or stderr) to expect to receive, and waits for
the client to create the streams.

After the kubelet has received all the streams, it executes the command in the
container, copying between the streams and the command's stdin, stdout, stderr,
as appropriate. When the command terminates, the kubelet closes the upgraded
connection, as well as the underlying one.

Architecturally, there are options for running a command in a container. The
supported implementation currently in OKD invokes nsenter directly on the node
host to enter the container's namespaces prior to executing the command.
However, custom implementations could include using `docker exec`, or running a
"helper" container that then runs nsenter so that nsenter is not a required
binary that must be installed on the host.
