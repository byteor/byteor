# Kubernetes Network

## Infrastructure Network

The network your physical (or virtual) machines are connected to. Normally your
production network, or a part of it.

## Service Network

The (completely) virtual (rather fictional) network, which is used to assign IP
addresses to Kubernetes Services, which you will be creating. (A Service is a
frontend to RC or a Deployment). It must be noted that IP from this network are
never assigned to any of the interfaces of any the nodes/VMs, etc. These
(Service IPs) are used behind the scenes by kube-proxy to create (weird)
iptables rules on the worker nodes.

## Pod Network

This is the network, which is used by the pods. However it is not a simple
network either, depending on what kubernetes network solution you are employing.
If you are using flannel, then this would be a large software defined overlay
network, and each worker node will get a subnet of this network and configured
for it's docker0 interface (in very simple words, there is a little more to it).
If you are employing CIDR network, using CNI, then it would be a large network
called cluster-cidr, with small subnets corresponding to your worker nodes to
these small subnets. This is proved to be a challenge on AWS VPC router, but
this is piece of cake on a simple/generic router in your network.
