- nameservers

a list of IP addresses that will be used as DNS servers for the Pod. There can
be at most 3 IP addresses specified. When the Pod's dnsPolicy is set to "None",
the list must contain at least one IP address, otherwise this property is
optional. The servers listed will be the base nameservers generated from the
specified DNS policy with duplicate addresses removed.

- searches

a list of DNS search domains for hostname lookup in the Pod. This property is
optional. When specified, the provided list will be merged into the base search
domain names generated from the chosen DNS policy. Duplicate domain names are
removed. Kubernetes allows for at most 6 search domains.

- options

an optional list of objects where each object may have a name property
(required) and a value property (optional). The contents in this property will
be merged to the options generated from the specified DNS policy. Duplicate
entries are moved.
