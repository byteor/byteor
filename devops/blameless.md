# Blameless

In an environment where humans are blamed and punished for errors, *a culture of
fear can build up walls that prevent clear communication and transparency*.

Contrast this with a blameless environment, where issues are addressed
cooperatively and viewed as learning opportunities for individuals and the
organization.

The first environment views “human error as the cause of trouble.” This “old
view” is described as a mindset in which the focus is on elimination of human
error. Mistakes are made by “bad apples” who need to be thrown out. This view is
found in blameful cultures, as it assumes that errors are often caused by malice
or incompetence. Individuals responsible for failure must be blamed and shamed
(or simply fired).

The second environment views “human error as a symptom of trouble deeper in the
system.” This “new view” is a mindset that sees human errors as structural
rather than personal. People make choices and take the actions based on their
context and what makes most sense to them, not intentional malice or
incompetence. Organizations should consider systems holistically when looking to
minimize or respond to issues.

Understanding and embracing the “new view” is key to understanding the devops
movement. This view encourages us to share stories, as everything is a learning
opportunity. Shared stories:

• lead to increased transparency and trust within a team;

• instruct our coworkers in how to avoid a costly mistake without having to
  directly experience it; and

• increase the time spent on solving new problems, allowing for more innovation.

When these stories are shared throughout the industry, we impact the industry as
a whole, creating new opportunities, knowledge, and shared understanding.
