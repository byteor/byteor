# Agile Software Development

```text
individuals and interactions over processes and tools
            working software over comprehensive documentation
      customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        responding to change over following a plan

In 2004, Alistair Cockburn, a software developer who was one of the coauthors of
the Agile Manifesto, described Crystal Clear, a software development methodology
for small teams based on his 10 years of research with successful teams. It
described three common properties:

• frequent delivery of usable code, moving toward smaller, more frequent
  deployments rather than large, infrequent ones;

• reflective improvement, or using reflections on what worked well and what
  worked poorly in previous work to help guide future work; and

• osmotic communication between developers—the idea that if developers are in
  the same room, information will drift through the background to be picked up
  informally, as by osmosis.
