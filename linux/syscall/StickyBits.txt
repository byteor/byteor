Sticky Bits
===========

In addition to read, write, and execute permissions, there is a magic bit called
the sticky bit. This bit applies only to directories.

A directory that has the sticky bit set allows you to delete a file only if you
are the owner of the file. As mentioned previously, you can ordinarily delete a
file if you have write access to the directory that contains it, even if you are
not the file’s owner. When the sticky bit is set, you still must have write
access to the directory, but you must also be the owner of the file that you want
to delete.

A few directories on the typical GNU/Linux system have the sticky bit set. For
example, the /tmp directory, in which any user can place temporary files, has the
sticky bit set. This directory is specifically designed to be used by all users,
so the directory must be writable by everyone. But it would be bad if one user
could delete another user’s files, so the sticky bit is set on the directory. Then
only the owning user (or root, of course) can remove a file.

You can see the sticky bit is set because of the t at the end of the permission bits
when you run ls on /tmp:

    % ls -ld /tmp
    drwxrwxrwt 12 root root 2048 Jan 24 17:51 /tmp

The corresponding constant to use with stat and chmod is S_ISVTX.
If your program creates directories that behave like /tmp, in that lots of people
put things there but shouldn’t be able to remove each other’s files, then you should
set the sticky bit on the directory. You can set the sticky bit on a directory with
the chmod command by invoking the following:

    % chmod o+t directory
