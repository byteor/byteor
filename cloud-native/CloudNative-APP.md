# CloudNative Application

A cloud native application is engineered to run on a platform and is designed
for *resiliency*, *agility*, *operability*, and *observability*:

1. *Resiliency*

embraces failures instead of trying to prevent them; it takes advantage of the
dynamic nature of running on a platform.

2. *Agility*

allows for fast deployments and quick iterations.

3. *Operability*

adds control of application life cycles from inside the application instead of
relying on external processes and monitors.

4. *Observability*

provides information to answer questions about application state.

CLOUD-NATIVE APPLICATION IS DESIGNED FOR THE CLOUD AND RUN ON THE CLOUD.
