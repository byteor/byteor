# Start Release Engineering at the Beginning

Release engineering has often been an afterthought, and this way of thinking
must change as platforms and services continue to grow in size and complexity.

Teams should budget for release engineering resources at the beginning of the
product development cycle. It’s cheaper to put good practices and process in
place early, rather than have to retrofit your system later.

It is essential that the developers, SREs, and release engineers work together.
The release engineer needs to understand the intention of how the code should be
built and deployed. The developers shouldn’t build and “throw the results over
the fence” to be handled by the release engineers.

Individual project teams decide when release engineering becomes involved in a
project. Because release engineering is still a relatively young discipline,
managers don’t always plan and budget for release engineering in the early
stages of a project. Therefore, when considering how to incorporate release
engineering practices, be sure that you consider its role as applied to the
entire lifecycle of your product or service—particularly the early stages.
