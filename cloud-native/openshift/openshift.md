# Openshift vs Kubernetes

The Docker service provides the abstraction for packaging and creating
Linux-based, lightweight container images. Kubernetes provides the cluster
management and orchestrates containers on multiple hosts.

OKD (OpenShift community release) adds:

  1) Source code management, builds, and deployments for developers
  2) Managing and promoting images at scale as they flow through your system
  3) Application management at scale
  4) Team and user tracking for organizing a large developer origanization
  5) Networking infrastructure that supports the cluster
