# Poseidon-Firmament scheduler

## How it works

It models the scheduling problem as a constraint-based optimization over a flow
network graph â€“ by reducing scheduling to a min-cost max-flow optimization
problem. Due to the inherent rescheduling capabilities, the new scheduler
enables a globally optimal scheduling environment that constantly keeps refining
the workloads placements dynamically.

## Use Case Scenarios

- For "Big Data/AI" jobs consisting of a large number of tasks, throughput
  benefits are tremendous.

- Substantial throughput benefits also for service or batch job scenarios where
  workload resource requirements are uniform across jobs
  (Replicasets/Deployments/Jobs.).
