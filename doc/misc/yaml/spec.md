# YAML Ain't Markup Language (YAML) Version 1.2

## Abstract

YAML (rhymes with "camel") is a human-friendly, cross language, Unicode based
data serialization language designed around the common native data types of
agile programming languages. It is broadly useful for programming needs ranging
from configuration files to Internet messaging to object persistence to data
auditing. Together with the Unicode standard for characters, this specification
provides all the information necessary to understand YAML Version 1.2 and to
create programs that process YAML information.
