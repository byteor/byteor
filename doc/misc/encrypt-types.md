# Encryption Types

## Symmetric Key Encryption

In this encryption & decryption keys are the same. In order to achieve secured
connection both the parties should have the same key.

## Public Key Encryption

In this, the encryption key is published to anyone who want to encrypt the
message. Though, the decryption key which is used to make the message readable
is only to the person for whom the message is sent.
