The sticky bit originated in the PDP-11 versions of Unix and was applied
to regular executable files. This bit was applied to programs that were
expected to be heavily used, such as the shell and the editor. When a
program had this bit set, the kernel would keep a copy of the program's
executable code on the swap device, from which it could be quickly loaded
into memory for reuse. (Loading from the filesystem took longer: The
image on the swap device was stored in contiguous disk blocks, whereas
the image in the filesystem might be spread all over the disk.)

Modern systems have considerably faster disk and memory hardware than the
PDP-11s of yore. The also use a technique called demand paging to load
into memory only those parts of an executable program that are being
executed. Thus, today, the sticky bit on a regular executable file serves
no purpose, and indeed it has no effect.

The sticky bit on an writable directory prevents file removal from that
directory, or file renaming within it, by anyone except the file's owner,
or root.
