- The boot block occupies the beginning of a file system, typically
  the first sector, and may contain the bootstrap code that is read
  into the machine to boot, or initialize, the operating system.
  Alghough only one boot block is needed to boot the system, every
  file system has a (possibly empty) boot block.

- The super block describes the state of a file system -- how large
  it is, how many files it can store, where to find free space on
  the file system, and other information.

- The inode list is a list of inodes that follows the super block in
  the file system. Administrators specify the size of the inode list
  when configuring a file system. The kernel references inodes by
  index into the inode list. One inode is the root inode of the file
  system: it is the inode by which the directory structure of the
  file system: it is the inode by which the directory structure of
  the file system is accessible after execution of the mount system
  call.

- The data blocks start at the end of the inode list and contain file
  data and administrative data. An allocated data block can belong to
  one and only one file system.
