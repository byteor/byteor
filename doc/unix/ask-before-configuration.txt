1 Questions to consider whenever you find yourself thinking about adding a configuration option
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  • Can I leave this feature out? Why am I fattening the manual and
    burdening the user?
  • Could the program's normal behavior be changed in an innocuous way
    that would make the option unnecessary?
  • Is this option merely cosmetic? Should I be thinking less about how
    to make the user interface configurable and more about how to make
    it right?
  • Should the behavior enable by this option be a separate program
    instead?


2 Where configuration live
══════════════════════════

  • Run-control files under /etc (or at fixed location elsewhere in
    system-land)
  • System-set environment variables
  • Run-control files (or 'dotfiles') in the user's home directory
  • User-set environment variables
  • Switches and arguments passed to the program on the command line
    that invoked it
