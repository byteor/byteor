#+TITLE: Ask Before Configuration

* Questions to consider whenever you find yourself thinking about adding a configuration option

- Can I leave this feature out? Why am I fattening the manual and burdening the
  user?
- Could the program's normal behavior be changed in an innocuous way that would
  make the option unnecessary?
- Is this option merely cosmetic? Should I be thinking less about how to make the
  user interface configurable and more about how to make it right?
- Should the behavior enable by this option be a separate program instead?

* Where configuration live

- Run-control files under /etc (or at fixed location elsewhere in system-land)
- System-set environment variables
- Run-control files (or 'dotfiles') in the user's home directory
- User-set environment variables
- Switches and arguments passed to the program on the command line that invoked
  it
