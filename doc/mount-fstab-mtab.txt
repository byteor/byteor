/etc/fstab
==========

lists filesystem that can be mounted, Most are automatically mounted
when the system boots. The format is as follows:

device     mount-point    fs-type    options    dump-freq    fsck-pass
/dev/hda3  /              ext3       defaults   1            1
/dev/hda5  /d             ext3       defaults   1            2


/etc/mtab
=========

which is the same file format as above, mount writes information about
filesystems as they are mounted; umount remove information that file
when filesystem is unmounted.
